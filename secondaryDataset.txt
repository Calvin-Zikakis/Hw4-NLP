somehow cocacola has a way of summing up things so well
in the early 1970s they had as their flagship jingle id like to buy the world a coke to the tune of id like to teach the world to sing that pretty much summed up the postwoodstock era so well
it didnt add much to sales but it was a catchy tune
in korea cokes theme is stop thinking
which pretty much sums up a lot about korea and koreans
look at how relaxed that couple is now that they stopped thinking and started feeling
of course they have a high regard for education and math and logic and such but deep down i think many koreans really like to work on emotion more than anything else
westerners seem to sublimate this moreso or at least display it in a different way
westerners and koreans are probably pretty similar but the context in which we do it is different
anyways if you think youre losing it in korea just repeat to yourself stop thinking feel it
and everything will be alright
if anything korea is a country of extremes
i think it may come from koreas history
it has been invaded a reported 700 times over the years and each time they got independence i imagine they had to move quickly to get to the next level before the next war or occupation
lately well not really lately
in 1945 the japanese occupation ended
then the korean war occurred from 19503
after that there was turmoil but in 1961 park chung hee took over as dictatorpresident
he had elections in which everyone was encouraged to vote but he was still a dictator
after his assassination in 1979 the next few leaders were basically of the same ilk
president park did some amazing things in his time however
he took an incredibly backward country and set it on the road to industrialization
japan had stripped korea of its resources people and even its language and culture many buildings and palaces were razed and japanese was the official language here from 19101945 but president park was determined to change that
he orchestrated the han river miracle the han river or hangang is the main river in seoulkorea and korea made terrific strides if at the expense of some civil liberties
fastforward to the present and my point and we see that korea is the worlds 1 wired nation
more than canada finland and way beyond the u
there was a craze to have pcs pc bangs or rooms everywhere in the country
as well instead of playstationlike games where players go against the computer or one or two people korean gamers always the communal types play online games with hundreds or thousands of others
in typical korean fashion gamers who left their seat for a second could not pause their game
in fact they may be eliminated
so pcbang owners sold drinks ramen nooodles and other junk to their clientele
it was just a matter of time before someone died as related in this article
yes someone died from being on the pc
people thought he was just sleeping imagine how long he was there before they really checked him out but alas he was the first known casulty of the net in korea maybe the world
korea built on extremes both good and bad
take a read of this news article from joongang ilbo about north koreas opinion on the scaling down of troops in seoul and korea specifically 3600 troops are heading to iraq and by the end of 2005 the current total of 37000 should drop to about 24500
troop cuts north korea again blasted the united states yesterday for what it calls an increase of u
defense capabilities after the planned relocation of 3600 u
troops in south korea to iraq
pyeongyangs staterun television network said the plans were preparations for a second korean war
even though part of the u
ground forces will be transferred to iraq instead of causing a capability vacuum u
president bush is augmenting his war policy against the north the broadcast complained
security commitment to south korea is a commitment for preemptive war against us the current affairs commentary said
ok let me get this straight
moving troops out of south korea and further out of the area closest to north korea the dmz or demilitarized zone is somehow increasing the u
defense capabilities in south korea well ive read a lot of north korean propaganda such as at dprk
com check out the dprk news section but this one is pretty unreal
and with that id like to remind everyone that those in the dprk i should tell you that means democratic peoples republic of korea or north korea are probably very good people its just the leadership that seems to be making all the waves i could be wrong but im not going to go up there and find out
the korean war from 19503 was a brutal event that severed many families
some of whom are now lucky enough to see their aged relatives again remember its been 50 years in special reunion projects albeit only for a few hours before everyone is whisked off to their respective countries
many however have or will pass on without ever seeing a sister brother child parent or boygirlfriend again
we in the west especially canada where weve never had a war on our own soil except the war of 1812 could never fully comprehend such things
it really makes your wonder how far one would go to support ideology
i guess we have an idea now
i surf the english news sites a lot looking for tidbits on korea and how foreigners like me view the hermit kingdom but also as a way to keep up with this fastmoving place
sometimes though one needs to check the veracity of the figures put in the papers
here are two examples of how the english version of the korea times and that of the joongang ilbo daily
the first is pretty straightforward
korea times said that 249 people were arrested for forging korean passports but joongang ilbo says just 114 were accused
huh another one joongang ilbo said that sp is positive on korean banks a good thing while the korea times said that sp was a tad worried about the bad loans that banks extended to small and mediumsized firms
i have no idea why the simple facts seem to be presented so differently
it cant simply be translation can it
it looks so difficult at first then as you figure out how to read hanguel koreas surprisingly easytolearn alphabet of 24 characters it seems so easy
then the backwards to us sentence structure
yikes luckily there are many options for us slowwitted foreigners to take on the language
of course i could list them here but this joongang article says a lot and there are more resources here
well if youre a guy here is some motivation for you jeon ji hyun the latest 20something 24 actually star of movies and cfs i hear this means commercial feature but not positive
i saw her latest movie on sunday night
its hard to describe the name
the english version is windstruck but the korean version is yeochinso which is short for ne yeojachingu rul sogayhamnida or id like to introduce you to my girlfriend
surprisingly both titles make sense
if you like there is a website korean and english looks quite good actually here
the movie is shown in theatres with subtitles at special times that info is here
for a list of many of the theatres in seoul click
here here is a great reason to learn korean
if i wasnt already married that is
i went with a few foreigners as well as a localkoreannational
of course the korean had to take a picture
so i have to put it up here
here we are after the movie
update a bud of mine passed this link on to me
its in a giordano ad
apparently it was not aired in korea nothing xxx about it its all about sensibilities of some sort
if you click on my profile youll make a notsostartling discovery
i was born in year of the pig as they say in the koreanchinese calendar
com figured it would be more appropriate to call it year of the boarbore
anyways you may be wondering how a fat lazy smelly canadian guy born in a little town waaaaaay up north finds himself in a place like seoul
and yeouido no less where only a handful of foreigners visit let alone live and work
the culprit is my wife
she is korean as you may know and when i was doing financial consulting in canada we came across an interesting client
he found us through his wifes see a pattern here korean women rule the men reading my column in the vancouver chosun chosun is the name of the last dynasty to rule koreait was ended by the 19101945 japanese occupation which youll find here
its all in korean my email and webpage have changed though
anyways this client is a big guy here in seoul as well as in canada and wanted for some reason to do something for us
so the next time he went to seoul we went as well with our first son second one wasnt around yet
when we arrived in seoul for our 23 week visit we met his godfathers as he called them
he wasnt mixed up in anything he just liked the sound of being untouchable
from there we met another guy then another guy and then the next day my current ceo
we had what economists call a coincidence of wants
he wanted a foreigner with training and experience in securities and alternative assets and i wanted a guy with the connections to get things done in seoul
after a week or so of meeting for dinner and such his english was pretty good and is better now but my wife did a lot of translation in the first part he said dont go back to canada stay here and work with me
i knew he had a more enlightened view than most korean bosses right then and there
its not perfect i cant speak a lot of the language and sometimes i almost go nuts here what with the differences in culture and business but its not bad at all
i also go home every 2 months or so my wife had baby 2 in canada and is still there for a bit longer which means lots of time in airplanes
i always fly singapore air but even then the prospect of being in the air for 100 hours a year is not all that appealing ya thats over 4 days flying over 1 of the year
i do however watch about 2025 movies a year on the plane which is cool because singapore air has individual monitors with ondemand tv and movies for all passengers
last night was pretty fun
mostly because of the company i kept
i recently met a couple of financetypes here in yeouido which isnt too hard to do as its referred to as koreas wall street who spoke pretty good english which is a rarity here not only in yeouido but everywhere in korea
they had studied outside korea and deal with international business
but still my brutal canadian accent made it pretty tough for them to figure out what i was saying sometimes
there was one time that their accent got in the way though
when we went to the restaurant the guy junseok the gal is named hyekyung asked do you like deok i wrote it just as i heard it
i thought he meant dog they eat that here so i called his bluff and said sure lets go what kind of dog oh no deok deok ya dog no deok he said again
then i figured out that he meant duck and said oh 5072447532 ohri duck not 44060 gay dog why didnt you just speak korean i know 5072447532 and 44060 the food was great then we went to the obligatory eecha thanks hyekyung for the correction or second round
koreans can never just go to one place to eat and drink
usually we will wander the streets and go out to three four or five places
a couple of weeks ago in hongdae university bar district here we went to 4 places the 493284520951648 sannakji living octopus restaurant old rock cool bar a 454324700048169 noraebang korean word for karaoke and finally clubnb or noise basement until the wee hours of the morning
personally i prefer the kangnam version of clubnb but since we were in hongdae we went to that one
the coolest thing here about barhoppingpubcrawling is there is almost never a lineup and very rarely a cover just in the clubs never in bars
i think this is because people are always moving
in canada if you get in a bar you never never leave until you go home
which means those who want to get in have to lineup
also if a korean is asked to wait for anything especially after a few drinks they will just balk and leave
and no barowner would like that
maybe thats why koreans in general are moving around more and canadians are so sedate relatively
if youve lived in both places you know what i mean
update looks like everyone wants to be on my blog
here are the pics of my gracious hosts of the evening
junseok who works in international business and has an mba
hes trying to come up with a fitting western name for himself if you have one to suggest just leave a comment please
haekyung who works with him
she too has an mba and from my wifes alma mater of ewha womens university no less
haekyung is really good at english and is quite bright
and single men take note
she thinks her face looks like the moon or daldeongee as they say here i guess so
there is so much that is different here from anything ive ever seen well i havent travelled that much just in canada the us philippines and japan
and i mean totally different
maybe its because ive been here long enough to see a lot i dunno
anyways if youd like more on this place take a look at my virtual tourist pages
here it is the superfantastic phonebox today is a great day
our lovely officegirl jung mi please no letters thats what secretaries are called here went to lg twins building and got me a new phone
i really needed one on account of i my old one was all in korean
which was fine because i memorized where to go to do things on it
and ii the screen kept going blank because i produce copious amounts of sweat when i inline skate and was dumb enough to be on the phone at the same time
well after 4 screens at 60000 won a pop i decided its time to get a new one
but i may end up breaking this one too
it has a little camera which i used to take a picture of the box of course it took me a while to figure out that i couldnt use it to take a pic of the actual phone
i also took a pic of our lovely officegirl
and then inputted her name and number as well
then ordered up caller id something i didnt have before much to my chagrin
then i asked her to call me to test it out
her mug showed up on the little screen on the outside of the phone how cool is that and she immediately started panicking and saying change change haha some korean girls really hate to have pictures taken of them
she did however insist that i put the pic on this posting
i can take pictures email them or send to other phones and send and receive normal emails too
also it has a language converter so everything is finally in english
like the size of a fat businesscard
here she is doing the korean sign for take my picture
here is a coworker of mine with the same pose
one thing i love about seoul and i mean this about korea in general
i just happen to be a little seoulcentric is the street sellers
i dont really trust the food they sell on the side of the road except ice cream but virtually everything else is fair game for me
for example to get ready for my trip to canada and generally stock up in the last two weeks i bought 2 plants in a can for my nieces 8000 won 2 lightweight sports shirts for inlining 10000 won for both 1 pair of shorts for inlining 20000 won 3 bags of dried goguma sweet potatoes or yams they were selling 1 for 3000 won 2 for 5000 but i got 3 for 6000 1 tie at an amazing price of 5000 won or usd 4
and i cant really tell how its worse than the ones i bought for usd 100 back home
10 disposible razors for 1000 won or usd 0
80 for all ten 1 noisemaking toy hammer for boy 2 1000 won 3 disney photo albums but im sure ol walt didnt make a penny on these
just 1000 won each the clothesseller guy spoke pretty good english
i know because he held my hostage for 5 minutes as we talked about how korean men are getting fatter hence his stock of larger sizes for husky guys like me and how he learned english working for the us army about 2030 years ago
the gogumaguy didnt know a lot of english but he did speak spanish owing to the fact that he lived in argentina for a few years
unfortunately spanish is not one of my languages
i know a fair bit of french from my schooldays a smattering japanese and of course some korean
anyways when i passed the gogumaguy later in the week i gave him a big hola spanish for hello and the extent of my proficiency and he returned one as well
wow bridging the cultures with another one
below is a picture of the famous yeouido tietruck
this guy stops in the hotspots and unloads silk and polyester ties on neckwearhungry salarymen
here they are 2 for 5000 won usd 4
wonderful ohgyupsal at my favorite pork restaurant
its official pork has now outstripped beef as the top meat import to korea
see joongang ilbo link and no wonder
what with mad cow disease and avian flu virus going around
the only thing that seems safe is pork
of course as you may know ohgyupsal literally means 5 layers of fat
so maybe its not super healthy
well i wasnt that bad i did do 2 hours of inline skating as they call it here
rollerblading seems to have a tough time rolling off the korean tongue beforehand
but the was drowned by a lovely concoction called ohshipsayjoo which is a 5050 mix of baeksayju literally hundred year alcohol and soju literally booze thus the translation of the combined drink is called 50 year alcohol
here is the latest from the korean rumor mill it made it all the way to coquitlam and my wifes ears
it seems the grand hyatt hotels in itaewon j
mahoneys has a reputation for beautiful korean ladies using it as a place to pick up foreign likely white men
so if youre single and looking for a good time check out j
s just bring a lot of dough the prices are about two times that of most other western bars
well thats up to you you should know that some of the gals on the prowl there are ladies for sale there was well and the prices are reportedly quite high
if your man is in seoul and reading this or otherwise knows the score better get a polygraph
from what i saw some of those gals are pretty good looking not that i was looking of course
well thats it for tonight
i gotta take the boy to school tomorrow at like 9am which is early for my vacationtime now
well i stand corrected again
yesterday i blogged that coquitlam was an oasis of whiteness in the sea of asians that is vancouver but oh how i was wrong
we went to the aptly named coquitlam mall today and put spencer in the play area with a few other kids
i heard a lady speaking korean to her boy then a flock well three ajumas older korean ladies came and sat near us
later when we went to the pool we saw that the neighbors right next to us and across the street are koreans too
then on the way back i learned that another two sets of neighbors are korean as well
theyre everywhere its actually pretty cool
one thing about koreans is they have a pretty good sense of community
get a group of white people who arent farmers together and we seem to be pretty standoffish
or at least it takes a while to warm up
koreans as you may know refer to each other as sister or brother as soon as 3 minutes of meeting one another as i have seen
this is i think quite extraordinary
from first meetings with my son my wife called the girls in the area nuna or older sister as said by a younger brother they have a special word for every family member
also since koreans dont normally take to english all that well or quickly they really really appreciate speaking with someone from home
thus the community here is quite tight
so ive still got jetlag
although its pretty nice not to have to work through it
the boys tend to keep me moving all day though
usually i sleep at 3am or 4am then get up at 11am but its not a good rem sleep
my best sleep seems to be 12 hour naps at 3pm or 7pm
when i wake up from those its really like getting up in the morning and getting up in the morning is like waking up at midnight
my fatherinlaw thinks i should just adjust 100 in like 2 days but im not sure if im built that way
if i need to i can do it but its like im on vacation here
besides i do my work at night anyways when the kids are asleep and seoul is awake
i guess thats it for now
nothing more profound than this from the day which is a little sad
i love it here so clean peaceful and easy to live but i kinda miss seoul too so dirty loud and easy to get run down by deliveryboys on motorcycles
so ive been in vancouver a few days now
its really an interesting place i used to think it was full of chinese people not that theres anything wrong with that but vancouvers 1 mother tongue is mandarincantonese so youd assume thered be tons here
our area is up on a hill in a little bit of paradise actually
it has started to remind me of newport in that show the o
well it isnt full of million dollar homes but there are a few but the topography is similar hills lots of parks but no beach and its really really white here
i think the only koreans ive seen have been family and ensign harry kim on star trek voyager ya still have jetlag
watching anything that hits the screen here
on that note i think im having t
well with the kids i dont get to see too much of it but when i do im boggled by the 60 stations and thats not even satellite and all save one of them are in english wow in seoul i didnt even bother with cable so all i had was afn american forces network that guy on the homepage is their 630 newsanchor
the very reason i like to inlinerollerblade from 68pm
even if you have cable you only get like 23 other b movie stations
nothing to write home about
truth be told though afn has a pretty good lineup and i get to learn all about opsec operational security and that the u
army in korea is looking for e4s and e5s enlisted ranks to be mps military police
so if you can handle the g
ads afn is pretty cool
anyways i didnt remember so many ads for weightloss programs getrichquick schemes and fantastic kitchen products but there they were
of course in korea most people are pretty fit and they know the best way to get rich is to marry rich or work hardthere are some ads there for kitchen and cleaning product though proving that some things truly are universal
one ad that did throw me though was one for a male enhancement pill
what you take a pill for a bigger willi one version even had about 30 allusions to wood throughout it
i thought it was a spoof
it was on cnbc during the dennis miller show
if anyone knows please comment
ok back to my time here
we went down to the clubhouse to have a dip ya its a little swanky
but the pool is outside so its not superswanky and there were some 18something gals there sunning themselves and gabbing
man this is not seoul
for one thing no one actually tries to get a tan in korea
they wear darth vaderinspired visors to keep out all the rays they can and everyone is totally covered up
even when exercising korean have pants longsleeves even suits
also two of the three of them were plus size
they weighed like 23 times that of a typical korean gal
not that thats a bad thing
then you have to think
if they are 18 arent they still in school by that i mean they have not graduated from college
an 18year old korean would be in the library or at a dvd bang at least
most likely not at a pool and i hear theyre there everyday for hours on end
even after school is finished theyd be working or looking for a husband or both
lets face it many koreans have little time to be idle i must say they do take time to drink and go to the sauna though
maybe im becoming too korean now beating up these gals simply for having a little fun
all i know is if they did that in korea people might think they are r
room salon or places where men pay women to drink with them sing with them and
maybe thats part of the korean ideal
women should study and work and find a husband and if they are wasting their time everyday then they must be of low moral fiber
there could be something to that
maybe its part of the reason why so many korean gals work their butts off literally korean women are usually devoid of a derriere and seem to push off their own pleasure in some calvinist tradition
korean men seem to support this as it not only support the confucius ideals that many koreans follow but makes their place as symbolic leader of the home that much more solid whether it is deserved or not and we know that in many korean homes a strong wife controls more than she advertises
whenever i see a pregnant korean lady i really feel for her because i know that within a few months she will have a 35 year sentence to complete and utter childrearing duties
as with most things korean mothers go all out
right from before conception to
today i got a taste of that
what a day my 3year old spencer woke me up at 9am which is early seeing as i still have some jetlag and was up from midnight to 3am last night
the younger winston was already up too
my wife and i must have fed these kids like 57 times during the day they just never stop spencer and i went to his swimming class
we get a discount on regular swimming since hes enrolled
the gal behind the counter asked if he was swimming outside of the class as well
i really had no idea what was happening and said im not sure
she said in no uncertain terms that it meant a lot to her whether he was or not
i just said ok he is how much lets see 1
youve got to be kidding youre bent about chunon 1000 won1
15 this would not happen in seoul
theyd see spencer and pay him to come into there anyways what i did with him in the pool was pretty much what the instructor did as well
but she had 3 kids to handle
i thought hed be doing lengths or strokes but i guess not yet
after swimming i got my wife a starbucks coffee
she loves the stuff and apparently cant justify to herself to buy herself one
those selfless korean women bless their hearts
after i came home there was shopping to do
i volunteered to go kudos for me and time to think then i suggested spencer come too thought hed fall asleep in the car especially after swimming then thought we might as well all go the list she gave me was going to take a couple of people to complete
well the kids stayed up the whole time and i started to realize that this parenting thing is a lot harder when the kids are actually in the country with you im usually in seoul and its just you two her mother and sister were out of town
good god these kids didnt sleep until 11pm someday theyll make great investment bankers i mused
to all those out there who are single parents or even just parents get yourself a starbucks
you may not be able to drink it before it gets cold but at least you have a piece of luxury in your hand for a few seconds
my wife posed a strange question to me tonight
apparently this is the new fad in korea
men are asked if your wife and your mother are drowning neither can swim and you have time to save just one of them who would you choose
many men say my mother because i can always remarry
but i can never replace my mom
ok true enough but usually its the wives who ask this and one fellow i know said in front of a throng of relatives including his wife that hed save his mom
the wife was not impressed
lets look at this on a more cultural level for a moment
much of korean tradition is based on confucius teachings where younger take care of elder women take care of men and duty to family is first
parents sacrifice a lot for their kids to get them the best education lifestyle and necessities children in turn are expected to do the same when they have the means
thus a man should choose to save his mother who did everything for him and perhaps still does rather than his wife who is a bit of a latecomer
the reason for all of this ultimatum questioning comes from family conflict
a husbands mother often endures a lot from her husband children society and her own motherinlaw and not one to stop the cycle she will often unleash her frustration on the unsuspecting wife
she comes to pry into advise upon and attempt to control many parts of the couples lives under the guise of helping her dear son
with divorce becoming more accepted and this has broken up more than a few marriages lately and now people are getting a little preemptive perhaps in asking the husband to make a choice in order to ascertain his convictions
so men if you get this question posed to you first think of who is asking it probably your wife take a look around the room to find out who is listening and then give the best answer you can
just remember you likely sleep with your wife every night not your mother
as readers will know my favorite airline is singapore air sai
they have those personal monitors for everyone with ondemand movies tv shows and games
and some lovelylooking stewardesses of course
another thing going for them is their empathy with their passengers
ive twice been bumped up to business class with its better meals and basically flat sleeper beds
what an experience that is
once because the travel agent made a mistake and sai decided theyd make my life a bit easier hint if you take the same flight 510 times they get to know you too and another time my flight was overbooked so i too business to san francisco and got another one to vancouver both covered by sai as well as 500 sing 300 usd 350000 won which made for a 40 discount from my ticket price
anyways this time i was in line for about 30 minutes maybe it was longer and a few times i squatted to relieve my legs a bit
the gal at the counter apologized and put 2 solitaire tags on my bags will upload pic when i get back to seoul so you can put your color printer to good use and make a few of your own that basically put them on par with business class for unloading
the meals on the flight were good there were lots of good movies and as usual they gave me one of those sleeper masks when i asked for it in business its automatic but if you ask in economy youll get one
upon arrival in vancouver i saw a rare sight the customs area was packed a cruise was in port and normal flights all bunched up to
not to worry though as just as i approached the line they opened another area of inspectors
and in about 10 minutes i was picking up my bags
to top it off my cabbie spoke english something that eluded me in seoul and vancouver much of the time and we had a pretty cool conversation about life marriage and cultures
he too believes that once you stop looking for a spouse youll meet them
a little wisdom for you singlebutlookings out there
my phone can take pictures here but needs a special chip to connect
i forgot its charger and extra battery and already ran down the old one
so thats the only blotch on this trip so far which aint too bad
ive decided to start to teach him my limited french
which should keep him on his toes
hes already got some of the accent down when he speaks babytalk
when i was in seoul these last few months i thought my wife had it kinda easy here with just our 2 kids to take care of
now i know that this parenting thing is pretty tough
the worst thing is they tag team us
for example one stays up til 330am the other wakes up at 7am
one has a nap and the other gets hungry
and my wife isnt into lots of crap food for them too
so she is constantly cooking and preparing wonderful delicacies like rice brocolli cheese tofu cakes and seaweed and beef soupsounds great eh well the kids like it and i guess its good for them
when i go back to seoul i know ill miss these days and nights and start my old routine of 6pm rollerblading and going out to the bars on the weekends maybe even during the week a bit as my cfa test is finished for a few months
i know the days will be a little less full without my 3year old jumping from the couch onto my stomachebackgonads
ah how can i survive we will have the webcam and daily phonecalls to make things a bit easier but it wont be the same
its past 11pm and i know tomorrow will be busy
and the next day too
my bud of almost 25 years is coming to visit and ill make the trip to the ferry terminal to pick him up and the new place is now inconveniently 60 minutes from the docks compared to 30 minutes for our old place
no matter i imagine ill relish the time alone on a simple car trip
you may have noticed a new feature on my blog
its a blog email notification thingy blogarithm
all you need to do is put your email in the space and keep it fresh and youll get an email every time i update this blog
i use this on blogs that i normally read once i get better at code ill actually have them posted on this page too and find it pretty handy
the last few days have been pretty hectic
basically in the pool our complexs or the public one everyday and running around with the kids and not getting a lot of sleep
my wife and i take turns one was up til 3am last night the other awoke at 7am
man getting back to seoul and my bachelor pad will be like a vacationno matter how much work i have at the office
korea especially seoul is pretty cool and canada especially vancouver is pretty cool too
here are a few things i will and will not miss things to miss about korea being a celebrity well a little one at least
just for being me 100 kinds of ice cream at the local convenience store and all for 500 wonusd 0
40 7 24hour convenience stores within a block or two of my place inliningrollerblading along the han river bars with no lineups barhopping to at least 24 places in a night korean people not worrying about water on the floor of my fully tiled bathroom superefficient subways supercheap cabs where the subways leave off no taxes no tipping great food and seconds for free alcohol available at any store eating live octopus i mean live as in swimming around in a bowlon a plate on the table getting free fruit andor tea andor coffee andor sugary drinks after every meal
things to miss about canada no pollution or not noticeable at least good mixed drinks like dr
pepper and long island iced teas although thats changing in seoul now our complexs pool just 5 minutes away and its usually just us or a few people there burgers that are not served raw hellloooooo heard of ecoli
things not to miss about seoul drunk guys pissing in the streets at night well i am one of them sometimes people always thinking im crazy for not liking tofu paying like 10 for enough ground beef for 2 hamburgers having to go to the foreign food section to get my mms
things not to miss about canada lineups and cover charge at almost every good bar larger canadian chicks hey no flamings please union leaders who think someone should make 20 an hour to pick up trash when korean 60yearold men do it in seoul for like 100 a month vancouver rain in the winter
5 sales tax tips treated as if they are expected no matter the service having to go to the foreign food section to get my ramen noodles
it seems everything is not all that smooth in seoul concerning the recent changes
this makes sense because as koreans would they decided not only to change the payment system but also all of the bus colorschemes routes numbers and routes and even the structure of the roads in some areas of the city see pic below of a fast lane for buses in one of the worst traffic areas of the city

life in the fast lane
this may be a long blog
got a lot of thoughts going through my head this last couple of days not least because of my reading a mathematician plays the stock market a very cool book and one that i wish i read before embarking on the cfa designation exams wrote 2 of the 3 required exams already
anyhoo went out for some drinks last night yes thursday night a school night but i really wanted to break this jetlag and i find that going out is one of the most effective and most fun ways to do so at a little place called hans sausages near hongik university usually referred to as hongdae
so upon ordering the bratwurst and beer i noticed something interesting the beer came in a special pitcher that has dry ice in a compartment in the bottom of it and passages that allow the vapor to flow to the top and escape
pretty cool idea and i had seen it before in another bar in sinchon another teenbar district near hongdae
while out on the town i started to think what are the odds that i know someone here in this bar or meet them on the street likely pretty low but then i remembered the last night i came here and got a call from an old coworker who was basically 2 blocks from me and had just had 493284520951648 sannakji living octopus in a little place that we almost went to now that was interesting
then i remembered that a friend of mines former girlfriend is in koreanot seoul in pusan
but her sisterinlaws friend is engaged to a korean girl in daegu who often comes to seoul hongdaesinchon specifically to see friends
so what if one of the thousands of people i saw were one of those friends how many degrees of separation is that two to the pusan friend or one if you count that i know her now plus three to the groomtobe or two as the pusan friend already knows her sisterinlaw and two more to the friends in seoul
so thats 4 to 7 degrees not bad
i could also suppose that the people on the street know my wife or one of her friends as she went to school there but we are older than these kids and its not quite as interesting a story as going to vancouver then daegu then back to seoul
another area yesterday i met some guys from an asset management firm here for business
one spoke quite good english and when he found out i was from vancouver he noted that his brotherinlaw is living here
as well the owner of the 493404422853461 samgyetang ginseng chicken soup place across from my apartment has a home in a suburb of vancouver
what are the odds of that now lets deconstruct this a bit and take a bit from my current reading and suspend for a bit the idea that i have incredible selective memory and am merely drawing connections from random events
on the beer both restaurants were in the same relative are more or less and it makes sense that a seller of those dryice pitchers would service both of them
for the people on the street the university district is full of school kids school kids are not usually especially in korea destitute poor and they are by definition educated or nearso and it is the welltodo and educated that end up going to foreign countries and meetmarry foreigners there are exceptions just humor me for a bit
thus it makes some sense that i who knows many educated people in korea and canada as i am one myself would have an ok chance to have some connection with similar people in another country no matter the whereabouts
this reminds me of when i spent a month in the philippines with my bud carlo who met a friend there who ended up being his distant relative
especially in places where the economicsocial strata is welldefined the top 1 seem to flock together
concerning the people who have ties in vancouver
proximity is one factor and wealth is another
vancouver is the closest airport to seoul one hour longer to go to san francisco and it also has an inviting climate and seems to attract the wealthy from many countries including the u
so it makes sense that these again welltodo and educated people would have some connection to my other home
whats my point and how does it lead to a better understanding of korean culture its this when you meet a korean or when they are on their first dates they will always ask questions to figure out if they have some connection such as age and ethnicity or school ties or anysuch thing that could prove a connection
for foreigners this kind of questioning is sometimes seen as rude but this is just a part of korea you get used to it
this is one reason that koreans study their butts off to go to the bestlargest schools such as seoul national university korea university ewha womens university and yonsei university and then put themselves through incredible stress to get into major companies such as samsung group
its because after all that study and hard work one will have instant camaraderie with fellow alumni and thus be able to move to vancouver when they retire and not have to work selling dryice beer pitchers to every bar in korea
ive always thought of seouls subways as a real joy to be on
they are clean fast efficientmore or less and cheap
buses on the other hand are a bit of a mystery to me
i take one bus regularly but thats it
taxis however are plentiful cheap and once you know a little korean pretty easy to use
now things are getting a lot easier and logical
as of today july 1st rates will be based on distance traveled rather than number of rides
this makes sense as it always irked me when you had to pay again to transfer from one bus to another or from the bus to subway this doesnt happen in vancouver
the new system just has you pay for the length of each little trip
as well my phone will be able to house my tmoney so i dont need to carry change or fish around for my wallet or storedvalue ticket
it can even be used in convenience stores and cabs soon and carry up to 500000 won or about 435usdtheres also a colorcoding scheme to the buses which may or may not make things easier
unless they have little maps on the buses i think most foreigners will find the new system about a confusing as the old but a lot of that has to do with the language and familiarity with a citydistrict that covers many many square kms

i have to learn more about cutting code so i can make this thing prettier
anyways seoul is 7 and the first canadian city is the big smoke as my dad calls it toronto at 89 then my recentdual hometown of vancouver at 96 i suspect itll rise next year as real estate is on a bit of a tear lately
thing is if you have the residencehome thing taken care of as most teachers do in korea then living in seoulkorea can be pretty cheap
of course you can always spend 4500 usd for a bottle of macallan 50 yearold whisky at skybar but if you keep your head on straight its not too bad
every morning i go to my local 711 and have 2 samgakgimbab literally 3angledtriangle seaweed and rice for about 1usd
today i splurged for a sayooshrimp burger but the price was still under 2usd
its good for dieting too as my wife nearconstantly reminds me because rice has 13rd the fat of bread and likely 1100th that of a croissant muffin or bagel
shrimp burger and triangle kimbap
koreans have a great sense of community
so much so that sometimes they figure they can have a nap any old place
now i understand taking a snooze in a subway car they are safer here or taxi done that a few times but on some steps well it happens
i couldnt resist taking a pic of this guy
it was like 6pm and he was already sacked out on the front steps of a building in sinchon teen district of seoul
notice his jacket is a step or so down from his resting place
must be nice to be in a virtually crimefree city
the business class tag for baggage
i have to keep this in pristine condition for future flights
i used to cook for myself all the time making bulggogi kalbi and even lasagna
now however im getting pretty lazy
food is so good plentiful and cheap in the restaurants nevermind that koeans love to go out to eat so if i did cook a large amount of food about half of it would go to waste anyways that ive decided not to shop for anything more than noodles and booze
see photos for the result
far from what i expected i ended up losing weight and spending about the same amount of money go figure
what a balanced diet i have
noodles and more noodles tuna gochoo jang sauce
my fridge the oranges are just for show theyve been in there for like 6 weeks
notice the contents ketchup mayo orange juice jejudo beer soju beaksayju mayshilju onions
i often wondered where the restauranteurs heated up the briquettes or brinks or rocks that they placed in the table for traditional korean cooking
this place not a good pic it was from a taxi with my phonecamera actually has a fire on the sidewalk right in front of it the guy is pickin out a redwhitehot brick for the patrons inside
fire in the hole
it feels like i didnt even leave this place which is a little scary
things will be a little weird for a bit as i take about a week to get over jetlag unlike some people i know who take about 2 days so postings may be a little sporatic for a bit
as well work is getting busier
which is fine my me
its kind of interesting actually
at this job we always have something to do i do the weekly newsletter research presentations to clients and liaise with our foreign partners but there are definate lulls and busy times
just before my vacation was a lull now were back in the thick of things
speaking of thick take a look at this pic
many days here are like this although admittedly not this brutal
some are blueskied but even then you know that the pollution is there
i left my windows upon when i went home and when i came back there was a thin layer of soot on the floor
hmmmm that seems real nice eh now i know why my motherinlaw always cleaned the floor every day or so
apparently seoul has double the amount of particles im assuming bad particles in its air
anyone who jogs here is nuts but i of course do inlinerollerblade almost everyday so im no better
one problem is the number of cars here another is the level of industrialization and lack of environmental laws or enforcement thereof but there is also the polution that comes over from china where things from what i hear are a lot worse and the yellow winddust that makes its way to our shores once or twice a year
i was in one of these storms a few years ago i was the only gomer without a surgical mask on and i felt pretty weird afterward
if you have a respiratory problem things could get ugly
its been a busy last couple of weeks but im on my way back to seoul today
didnt get near what i wanted to get done on this triphad planned on heading downtown to see a few buds but couldnt get the time to get away at all
a few friends made the trek up to our place though which was cool
its nice to see friends youve known for 1020 years after being away for a while
one guy that came up here was a friend of a sister of a friend who is marrying as soon as he gets the familial blessing a korean so my wife and i gave him the 411 on koreans and ways to do things
more on that when i get back to seoul and have more time
a night out in korea can seem pretty overwhelming especially in hongdae kangnam sinchon sincheon itaewon daehakro or any of the other major hotspots in town
hongdae sinchon and daehakro make a name for themselves by being close to the major universities kangnam is a place for lavishing highpriced liquors and girls on clients itaewon is near the us army base so its a haven for gis and other englishspeakers who seem to have more money than brains sometimes myself included and sincheon is a teen district as well in the welltodo area of songpagu
my latest foray was to daehakro daehakdaehakkyo means collegeuniversity ro means street
we went to a ddakkalbi grilled chicken place and saw a group of 3 guys whooping it up korean style copious amounts of soju and food and louder speaking
i dont know if he was doing it for my benefit or to showoff to the koreans around him koreans sometimes show that they know english as a form of oneupmanship
it shows they are educated and studied a lot no matter how brutal the usage
he was saying such things as excuse me could you calm down actually he said that a lot and im sorry and okay
i think he was practicing to be a bar bouncer or something
anyways these guys got pretty loaded
when one of them was away from the table it looked like the other two were a little amorous korean men sometimes hold hands or put their arms around each other especially after a gallon of soju
i snapped the picture below before we left
2 guys who really like each other but they are not gay
then when we finished walking nature was calling me
i took a look into the hwajangshil bathroom in the restaurant but it was a squattype
then we came across this theatre below
oh and koreans usually pronounce theatre and seattle the similarly
it was new so i took a look
man that bathroom was spotlessmaybe it looked so good because i figured that all of the ones in the area were squatters or brutally dirty affairs as they usually are in smaller older buildings man how do these women do it
look for the newest hippest building especially ones with western food or themes inside to find the best w
another way koreans denote watercloset
fantaseum since korea has millions ten of millions likely of cellphones handphones as they call them youll find public pay phones only in a few places the airport the trainbus stations major hotels and the subways
well ive seen them on the street sometimes but not that often and not when you need one
phones another instance of korean marketing gone bonkers
red mango is a major bingsoo shaved ice garnished with fruit and stuff and then topped with yogurt or ice cream
but the tagline for the firm is a little
well weird start loving myself
when i explain it to people they really get confused
red mango another thing here thats funny is girls wear shirts that say 69 its a brand here but they are oblivious to the hidden meaning if you dont know i cant explain it here this site is familyfriendly
or churchgoing girls will have a playboy scrunchie in their hair
not knowing who the hef is
koreans also have no idea the multitude of words we have for a part of the male anatomy so the scene in austin powers where they say woody johnston boner balls willi
goes over most of their heads
they have one word here for it gochoo hot pepper and theyre pretty surprised to learn that their word for ward in a city dong is also another euphemism for gochoo
and to cap it off in the subway there was a guy taking a snooze right on the floor
some of you may remember my first article on ohgyupsal five layers of fat pork
ohgyupsal is a oneup on samgyupsal three layers of fat porl so it only makes sense that this land of hyperbole would come up with chungyupsal 1000 layers of fat porkand it did
as amazing as it may seem someone got the great idea of leapfrogging all of the competition and calling what is basically pork chop a name that denotes something a little more superlative
why not trillion layers of fat pork jogyupsal i have no idea
the sign says 1000 layers of fat pork
well korea isnt the only place where things get blown out of proportion sometimes its just that they do it so well here and were not used to it
who can forget the launch of the gilette mach 3 yes thats what i need three blades on my face of course they had excel versions of their sensor mach 3 and ladies razors too as if we needed that little white strip to save from cutting our faces open
recently the schick quattro came out for those of you who failed latin italian audi or whatever language this is in quattro means expensive
now gillette has a power version of its razor
now this is getting ridiculous here in korea i get 10 good razors for 2000 won usd 1
5c each theyre so cheap i only use them twice then throw them away
please no greenpeaceecofriendly group flamings
and you know what i get a pretty good shave out of it too
similarly i only buy plain ol pork chops at home
sometimes this place really makes me think
so many things are so different here language expressions people culture shopping driving habits but yet some things are just like home
take my building for instance there are a few guards we call them ajeosshi or mister in the lobby
well theyre no so much guards as they are greeters like at walmart neat article here
after they figured i was not a visitor but a long term resident of seoul they started saluting me waving and saying morning
huh morning ok i guess they learned that greeting somewhere
many koreans in lowerlevel jobs know absolutely no english and what they may have learned these old timers probably had long forgotten so i appreciated the effort
then i was inline skating rollerblading to those of us who can pronounce it easily one lovely 4am and another said morning
then i got to thinking well it came to me while watching a kia ad that morning is everywhere in korea
this morning there i go again i saw a giveaway paper called korean phonetic of morning and then recalled the ad for kias subcompact car
a simple search on google korea came up with more an online bookstore an online flowershop a golf site and a news organization
then theres good morning shinhan one of the largest secutities dealers in koreawith its flagship building in yeouido one of the largest in town and flaunting its name albeit in hanguelkorean text for all to see
and of course this is the land of the morning calm
i could go on but you get the point
morning is not without its detractors though
about a year ago there was a major scam where a real estate developer conned million from many small investors
one lady summed it up well saying now i know what it is like to go from a rich person to a begger in one day
definately not a good morning for her
as an aside apparently another western idea is hamburgers and in north korea no less
heres your factoid for the day although most words are pronounced and even used differently than the original korean has incorporated about 10000 english words into its language much like tagalogfilipino has a lot of spanish and we westerners are comfortable with bon appetit and domo arigato mr
a readers will know shopping in seoul is a little different from back home assuming back home is a western country like canada the us uk
for one thing more things here you can haggle at almost every store and some for sure at every place that is not a store but like the picture below
this includes the department stores like migliore doota and hello ampm that are in dongdaemoon each area actually stalls of independent sellers but not such high classprice places like shinsegae or lotte depart
there is also no haggling at lotte mart lg mart nor emart but in those places youre getting a bit better surroundings than the true discount stores
anyways i find that haggling is a bit of an art
and it takes a little while to get the hang of it
after a while youll wonder why you dont get a discount back home though
there is also no tax on purchases its either included in the price or just not paidespecially at streetsellers
like today i went to namdaemoon for some shopping had to get a few undershirts and towels
i found a seller of both and asked the prices 2200 won for a shirt 1700 won for a towel
i offered 16000 compared to the 16800 total price
this is not a big discount just 5 but i was in a hurry and didnt have 5 minutes to haggle for 1
she said no discount again but i said in korean im buying 3 of these and 6 of these discount and she relented
oh it helps if you can do simple math in your head the seller sure as heck can and if you know enough korean to at least say the prices in korean
otherwise youre a bit of a mark
this store popped up literally right on the street near my work and the sellers were luring the office girls to try on their lovely selection of shoes
no guarantee but for 10 a pair and the way fashion trends have the life of a gnat here who cares get your ladies shoes right here
recently i downloaded gostop a traditional korean card game played almost exclusively by men yahoos version is here to my phone
there is one called sexygostop too for those who are into anime
well ive been playing it the clean version so much that my battery dies sometimes when im out is this an addiction
the last time was out at the movie theatre the mmc in dongdaemoon is open 24 hours if anyone is looking for a flick at 3am
a friend of mine said they have chargers at convenience stores i also remember them at some restaurants too
then we found that they had them at the theatre too
the young kids there knew how to hook up the battery
they were really helpful actually
koreans are so nice sometimes
heres a pic of what to look for if youre in korea and your phone goes dead
you stick your battery in here for about 510 minutes and its powered up but the charge wears down more quickly i think
more things i like in korea delivery services
i ordered a few books from seoul selection a great foreign bookstore that has an interesting newsletter thats worth subscribing toits free
anyways i ordered online at 300pm
the order showed up at my door at 930 the next morning
this would not happen in canada unless you paid extra for delivery and even then itd maybe be 2 nights as i ordered late in the day
korea though has a ubiquitous number of quick service delivery services as theyre called
this means it takes about 12 hours for a package to get across town because a motorbike courier takes it rather than taking it in a van to a sorting station then another van for delivery
its similar to the bike couriers that we have in the west but no one bikes on the roads here
i also like the way korea updates things
the pics below show one example
in the old days there was a rarefied breed of warrior who guarded the main palaces and nobles today there is another decidedly more leggy version
um this is a joke for those who believe everything they read
changing of the guard and twirling of the rifles
one of my favorite places in yeouido is wingswing located on the second floor of the building behind the lexington formerly the new manhattan hotel
its run by the soninlaw of a korean who spent 20 years in new york and atlanta running similar places
and now the old man is here to revamp it
they added 2 bar counters and hard liquor and recipes as well as more to the menus spaghetti quesadillas
last time i was there i had crown royal oh how i love it and the time before they served us this flaming dr
pepper which is a shot of bacardi 151 in a glass of beer
its not as tasty as the version i know amaretto shot in a 5050 beercoke mix but not bad
probably one of the few places in seoul you can get some of the booze this place hasand the only one in yeouido
over the last few weeks ive been to a couple of western movies troy and spiderman 2 and a few korean ones as well yeochinsowindstruck old boy gonggongui jockpublic enemy wild card and beomjwiui jaegooseongthe big swindle
i really liked all of the korean movies actually the western ones seemed pretty predictable compared to the korean fare but found it interesting that 4 of the 5 all but old boy were cop movies
to be fair in the big swindle it was more about the robbers than the copsstill the theme was intact
maybe this is typical to movies in general going in phases all of the movies are from the last year or maybe its just how again in korea things are very much fads where once a theme gets started its difficult to stop it
public enemy wildcard the big swindle and old boy with that in mind i think of my night out on saturday
a group of friends and i had dinner and a movie in the dongdaemoon area then headed to pronounced daehanro but the korean spelling is daehakro daehak means university ro is street so as you may have guessed it is a street near universitiesso of course there are tons of bars there
it was raining as a typhoon is in town see the typhoon tracker page for updates of when one is on its way here so there werent many people out on the town
i however didnt mind it as the rain here is pretty warm and i was in shorts a shirt and cutaway sneakers
we went to about 5 places before finding one called kkoon an intersting name
the gal running the place said it was their first business day but the place was empty
the music however was really good so i said service
as in what will you give us to come in she offered plates of snacks and such
sold the prices were lower than im used to too
so how does this connect the ambiance
the bar was like many other ones out there with tables low lighting club music and a table or two that has a trough in the middle for ice and imported beer and coolers we had 8 different kinds
i guess this is a safe business strategy as it may be fatal to go out on a limb with a new concept in this town unless it does very well in which case youll have lots of imitators
i wonder what the next trend will be whatever it is itll catch on fast
joongang ilbo article on this topic
in any developing country and i believe korea is developing and really only started on the road to a real economy with the onset of real elections in 1994 there can be trials and tribulations for those who lead politicians heads of business and follow workers students
dont get me wrong korea has made gigantic strides in the last 50 years thanks mainly to the irongrip of their presidentdictator from 1961 to 1979 park chung hee and in the last 10 years when korea really started to open up to western influencesbut things are still in a state of flux here
business practices have changed although they retain much of the old flavour politics
well politics seems to still be the same
relationships between people has changed albeit only a little koreans still follow confucius tenets and defer to age men and the learned and even language has changed as the internet and chatting has lead to the truncation of many words
with these changes comes inefficiencies
one can capitalize on them or be a victim
the lady in the bmw below may have done both
she is likely enjoying the ride in her z4 but according to this newspaper article she is also a victim of overpricingsomething that bmw i assume does not mind as they can have a higher profit
one other part of this may be that bmw has certain import duties over and above the government ones that need to be paid in order to sell their cars here such is another inefficiency
a pricey car in this town
but what about those who cannot afford a luxury car a flat in kangnam the priciest district in seoul and an expense account at the local watering hole or worse those who had it all and then lost it what happens to them well for some the answer is suicide hence my mention of base jumping buildings antennae spans and earth in the title
since there are few guns in korea heck many policemen do a barney fife and dont even walk around with a loaded gun the bullets are in their pocket the next best thing is jumping
while inline skating one day near the river i saw police taking 2 jumpers from the waterugthat was not cool
one thing that irks me about korea sometimes is the lack of discretion in some matters one faux pas i probably just committed above
we know that reporting suicide can lead to more suicides but they continue to report suicides as they happen
some of the stories are truly heartwrenching and i yes even i weep a bit when i hear some of themthis is not something you get desensitized to
if youre of strong mind take a look at this article on recent suicides
of course its not just in korea
military suicide is the 2 killer im not sure if friendly fire or actual action are 1 you start to wonder sometimes
the interesting thing i found from reading all of this not that it makes me an expert by any means is that korea although it may have the 4th highest suicide rate in the 29 oecd countries it was waaaay down the list globally korea always wants to be 1 compared to the top nations which is why they probably used this statistic
countries in eastern europe although some of these suicides may be underworld related scandinavia and even the us and canada hong kong and japan had higher rates than korea did in 1994
from table 1 in this paperabstract in true korean fashion the rates here went from 6
8 per 100000 in 1998 to 16
5 in 2000 and 18
man does everything here have a logarithmic curve to it some also turn to murder such as happened 10 years ago and lately again and im sure there were other cases inbetween but thats another story
perhaps this is just another part of living in a place where the past is meeting the future head on
koreans have an interesting saying when referring to guys like me gireogi appa wild goose dad
whenever i told koreans that i was here and my wife and kids are in vancouver they would call me this and now i know why
my boss explained it to me quite well although he called the bird a seagull as many koreans do
it goes like this a goose flies very high in the sky so does a vulture but i guess thats not as poetic nor as flattering and has very good eyesight
therefore it can see things waaaay in the distancewhich is good because thats where a s family is
it is used for koreans who go abroad to work as many do in the middle east on the many koreanlead construction projects there for the many families that have the wife and kids in a foreign place especially canada especially vancouver
there are so many there and the dad stays in seoul and for guys like me who come to work but whose wife likes vancouver soooo much she cant bear to live in seoul and put the children through such torture as is living here
its just another part of korea where things that dont make a lot of sense at first seem to be clearer once you get the whole story
the majestic beautiful canada goose

9 the roh administration seeks to scrap the park chunghees economic development model which created the miracle on the han river
10 the government has strengthened policies which would erode corporate competitiveness
to this businesseconomic list id like to add a cultural 10 mysteries of modern korean culture if i may
1 koreans often speak of love for their children and the sanctity of marriage but many men and women have lovers on the side
2 many korean parents or grandparents insist that children marry koreans even though they send their kids overseas to study or to hagwons language academies here
t not in my family tree 3 everyone seems to like the promise that is living in a different country but very few can make the move out of korea
4 koreans especially the young love the outdoors and clean air but they hate to live in the country
5 korean students hate learning english but older ones seem to love taking english classes
6 even after years of incredible progress koreans always compare themselves to foreigners the rodeo drive of seoul the silicon valley of korea the harvard of korea
7 most koreans seems to have a negative attitude toward u
soldiers here especially those who served in katusakorean army training with u
army but they dont seem to want them to leave and leave south korea vulnerable
8 koreans spend 1016 hours a day for years on end studying for major exams but at the end of it all dont seem to have a stored library of knowledge to use in everyday life or even at work
9 koreans are very over protective of their children and yet they have few child restraint seats and no one uses seatbelts in the back seats
10 many koreans have dogs as pets but many other koreans eat dog another interesting story came to me from a friend of mine
a group of 20 or so young people were on the subway when it came to a station with about 20 older folks waiting to get on
the kids were sitting down in the seats but without a word or any signals they all stood up together and offered their seats to the older folks
the more things change the more things stay the same
looking at korea one can see something of a leave it to beaver mindset when it comes to relationshipsespecially in the minds of 20something girls here
one could compare it as i will to a monk living life in a temple and then having everything changed when he starts to see what happens over the hills where he makes his home
thankfully some movies are starting to show that life may not be what we assume
recently i watched hi dharma a story about a gang of criminals that hides out in a monastery and ineo gongju literally means mermaid princess but is translated to my mother the mermaid or little mermaid a story about a daughter who somehow visits her parents when they first meet and fall in love
dharma is a comedy where the gangsters find out something about themselves within the relative purity of the monks and the monks gain a new perspective from their dichotic encounters
both learned that their socalled pure states of peace or brutality are not perfect and they can grow from knowing one another
the daughter in mermaid had a revelation as well
she hated her parents her father seemed a dimwitted postal worker and her mother a cussing rubbermasseuse at a bathhouse
she wished she were an orphan like her boyfriend
an odd occurrence i still dont know how this happened put her back in time to when her parents met on jejudo where her mother was a diver mermaid connection and her father a postman
she comes to see them in their innocence and pure statefull of dreams and potential not the broken and bitter people they became
a picture taken at that time shows the village in and around their first bus and her young father on his bicycle smiling
the daughter asks her mother why he is smiling
and in the last scene her mother says of course he is smiling what else could he be doing or words to that effect
yes the young have every reason to smile
my mother the mermaid and hi dharma mermaid seems to show that the pure state of youth and promise is a transient one and dharma could be saying that moving from purity may actually be good adding another dimension for growth
this is something that some young people here dont seem to grasp
they need to have perfect grades to get into the perfect university and get the perfect job and marry the perfect spouse and have the perfect family which means grandsons for many parents and inlaws
perhaps in the future less emphasis will be placed on keeping up with the kimsjoneses but for now many still aspire to a pure and perfect dreamlife
of course if they dont marry the perfect person koreans can now get a divorce quite easily
i must have been nuts
every 23 months i take off to canada for 13 weeks
my latest trip ended in late june and i ended up getting into incheon on sunday june 27th evening
just missing the canada day party
canada day is on july 1st but they staged the party early so itd land on a holiday
last year it apparently sucked and the beer was ob local brew not a canadian lager so i thought i might not be missing much
man what a mistake that was as you can see from the pic below
canadian guys chugging beer
canadian gals striking a pose
click to see larger version
heres your typical canadian situation
the boys are gathered around the beer and the gals are lookin fine
hey why arent the guys with the girls crazy canucks
just so you know this blog isnt about being political
if anything its about as apolitical as you can get for blogging
however there is something that i wanted to comment on you can use it to form your views or not
oh and i talk about some of the important points in here so if youre going to see the movie bookmark this and read it later
last night i saw fahrenheit 911 click for a local review and a trip to the warroom
it was a pretty good film
i had seen a few clips from it so i had an idea of what to expect which was kind of unfortunate
some said youll laugh youll cry and i think knowing that dampened the mood a bit
it may have been better if i didnt know what to expect and sorry now you know kind of what to expect so i opened a bit of pandoras box for you too
when getting the required popcorn and drinks 5000 won 4
50usd for a large tub and 2 drinks i was greeted by this guy below
i had to say thats quite a getup you got there knowinghoping he wouldnt understand
at the door to the actual theatre a guy and a gal in the same costume did a little salute as everyone filed in
i didnt think about them again until the end of the movie
soon hell be wearing a different uniform
fahrenheit 911 was a pretty interesting show
it tweaked a few memories i had from that day
when it happened i was in bed in vancouver just waking up
as a stockbroker i was wired to the daily news and had turned on my t
the news of the first plane was already broken and i was thinking what the heck some moron pilot slammed into one of the largest buildings in the world was it a terrorist when the second one hit i think we all knew that it was no accident
i watched it all that morning
waiting for the fires to be brought under control or maybe for another plane to hit another tower
who could tell what might happen it was especially surreal for guys like me i think egotistical eh
my dream as any guy in finance would havenbspwas tonbspbe to be in windows on the world the posh restaurant at the top of one of the towers giving a highpowered presentation to the moneymen of new york and the world
that dream seemed more like a death sentence now
i dont know what the emotion was but you might say i was relieved that i didnt go to wharton or have a ceo dad who might get me into that room on that day
of course you didnt have to be a financier to be there many bluecollar people firefighters and police and regular joes and janes were there as well
the next day i went to work
there was little to do and there was an eerie quiet as the sounds of the harborplanes were absent
all i could think about was the day before
i still wonder why the heck they showed the towers getting hit and then crashing to earth so many times in the weeks following
it sure didnt help my spirits
i knew what michael moore was up to when he made this film
his previous works included roger me where he went looking for the ceo of gm roger smith for answers why his hometown of flint michigan was laid waste by layoffs by the firm and bowling for columbine where he looked into the psychology of guns and violence that may have lead to the columbine shootings
i saw a show or something with him as he went all over the country promoting his newest book and noting that the employees of the bookstores were basically getting shafted by their employers parttimers with no benefits low salaries fired for small errors
hmmm sounds like korea in some ways
now im in finance mostly of the idea that business is good so even though i found the anecdotes he collected to be interesting and in some cases a little unsettling it didnt really change my thinking much
i think most of us are pretty set in our ways unless we get overwhelming evidence over a long period of time
i knew that moore would be going after bush but i had no idea how much he had on him or at least how bad he could make him look
moores 911 was as a documentary should be presented as a wellresearched factual and intellectual piece
it went into the histories of the major participants although not much on saddam and i was worried about how he said that iraq never hurt an american some of it smelled of hyperbole and presented the facts in logical sequence
then he threw in a curveball
he had a gal in there a wife and mother who in the beginning loved the u
and the armed forces a lot
she carried her american flag out each day to hang on the front of her housecareful never to let it touch the ground
later after her son died she hated what had happened in her country
ill tell you the worst part was how she was given the newsit was over the phone i remember in we were soldiers the army sent the notices to the next of kin by taxicab delivered by the drivers no less as there were so many dead they did not have enough officers to do the job
that i thought was a low point but this story plumbed the depths
clearly moore was not trying merely to make president bush look bad he made virtuallynbspeveryonecheney rumsfeld ricelook unprofessional but he could have done that to any of us who have been in front of the camera
he could have easily made the soldiers in iraq look like unfeeling grunts bent on discharging their weapons at anything and anyone which it seems they did do at times but that was chalked up to the adrenaline rush of being in a hot zone
no he went at things on a bit of a different tact
he personified not only the soldiers but something more identifiable not only for americans but for anyone who had a loved one in any countrys armed serviceshe made a poster child of those who are left behind temporarily or permanently when a service member heads off on assignment in this mother who lost her son
the mother pictured below is the real story and storyteller here
president bush is a major figure moore is the one who brought it all together but its her story that hits home more than any other
no 911 inquiry or senate committee can take away from her and her familys loss
her husband said it best though when he said we are very sad to lose our son in the war but we are more sad to know that families all over america are having the same thing happen to them right now
im paraphrasing from my fallible memory but i think you get the point
its the families that suffered when 800 troops were killed in iraq
we also cant forget the loss of those in wtc a disaster that was foreshadowed specifically in presidential briefings
nbsp for some their will to support the president and perhaps america itself may have been broken
i thought of our popcornseller above and how his family would react if he were shipped of to war trading one uniform for another
what if my sons were sent off without an imminent threat as we had in wwii and other respected wars how could you be proud of a country that did that to its children who is the main character in fahrenheit 911 president george w
bush michael moore or the mother of a fallen soldier so what is next will there be a sequel in a few years perhaps fahrenheit 38 degrees meaning the parallel of latitude that splits north and south korea and translated to celsius thats just 3
3 degreesclose to freezing kind of a cold war which is what we have here a war but no open hostilities
i doubt after all this that bush or any u
president for the next while has the political muscle to go after north korea and thats just fine by me
heck if anything happens seoul is within range of the norths artillery to say nothing of any missiles they may have that could get airborne and if the u
says they dont have the capabilities im inclined now to think that maybe they do
some things are different in korea
for one the two koreas are still technically at war
only an armistice or cessation of open combat was signed not a peace treaty
i read the north signed it but the u
declined to sign ithearkening to moores idea that the militaryindustrialpolitical complex needs a constant state of high alert and confusion to reach its aims which are mainly focused on money
im going to digress for a little bit here sorry
much of what we know as culture can be traced back to war
for instance the rhodes scholarship to oxford that former president bill clinton received was founded by cecil rhodes one of the wealthiest and most powerful men of his time so much so that the country of zimbabwes former name is rhodesia named after him
he made him money from exploitation of south african diamond minesa country which was finally conquered by the boer dutch in 1902 the same year rhodes died
as well the respected nobel prize was founded by alfred nobel who made his money from a little product he invented dynamitet
a technological triumph that is best known as the thing that makes things blow up as an explosives expert might put it
here there is really no question of whether the leaders are looking out for the people or themselves
a recent article reported that 74 of respondent to a survey of koreans said they believe politicians are lawbreakers
maybe the same is true in the u
but 74 pretty much tells you that people here dont need a michael moore documentary to know what goes on behind closed doors
im not sure if that is a good thing
the difference here though is the threat
as i said there is still a war going on
south korea has a mandatory term of military service for all male citizens with an 18month jail sentence for those who do not comply of course with a criminal record comes no chance of a job with the government or any larger company so its actually more of a life sentence
service is voluntary it may be seem coerced given the salespitch of the recruiting officers but it is in the end voluntary
those who are in the service and do not want to be redeployed to a place like iraq are subject to court martial and possible imprisonment
again the difference here is north korea has been saying for over 50 years that they are the real rulers of the koreas and they will take back the south while iraq did not make according to moore im not sure about this point threats toward the u
north korea also does not have any resources something that cant make the economy in that nontrading country very viable
anyways this is a record blog length for me and im glad you came along for the ride
my last word is simply that after moores 911 movie i think many people myself included will start to ask more questions and make creating such wars if i may go so far as that harder to do in the future
and that i imagine was its intent
korea is as you may have guessed a hypercompetitive place
once a store restaurant or whatever they always make a big deal of it
one of the best ways they have to get attention is dancing girls
girls in cheerleaderlike outfits dancing up a storm to hiphop in front of a balloon arc and inflated animals of some sort
its really quite a sight
when my cousin visited here last year we saw 2 or 3 of these things
his 20yearold brain was probably about to overload
this display i saw in namdaemoon as i did some light shopping actually i needed more hankies as mine was soppign wet from the heat humidity here these days
have no idea what this store is but i was sure tempted to take a look
welcome to the grand opening of
where am i anyways then we have bricx a little place ive walked past but didnt see a reason to enter
im not one for anime usually but this one
it took me a while to read it correctly
usually they say things like free drinks upon paying cover of 20000 won or something
i know ohoohodge podge has free drinks for ladies on thursdays from 10midnight but this one is a little more interesting
all gals in bikini tops get free drinks at bricx on that night
i wonder what theyd do if i showed up in my bromanzeer
finally take a look at seoul pubs video on picking up in seoul on seoul scenes website
the aussie in the rugby jersey is a regular there i mean like every night which is probably why hes featured so prominently
nbsp theyve got another one called bondaegi challenge in which unsuspecting passerbys are asked to eat
its actually quite well liked here
update i didnt make it to the bikini party but here are some pics taken at it here and here
i was going to hold off on writing this until i had a ton of pics of some of the public washrooms they have here but i had a pretty brutal experience in one today so i figured that was a sign or something
heres a restroom to avoid near line 4 at seoul station subway
as soon as i walked in i noticed the floor was dirty which is normally ok a little dirt isnt the end of the world
then i noticed a pungent odor
if i didnt have to go so bad 1 i might have bolted but instead i just let it go
man did i regret that
i tried breathing through my hanky but it didnt work the smell permeated everything
i was getting lightheaded from lack of oxygen and barely made it out of there
man i think they cleaned that place last when park chung hee was in power 19611979
ugh below are some interesting shot
take special note that they were all taken from the hallway of the building not inside the restroom
thus anyone walking by could not only see the empty stalls which is a faux pas in the west as it is but also the user of it if it is occupied
some also have a fantastic view from outside just in case you want two audiences
all of these pictures were from the hallway not inside the actual bathroom the one below is interesting
this bar in daehakro is the only place you can dance in the whole district or so its sign says but its also the most interesting bathroom
there is a doorwindow right beside the urinal that opens out to the alley
it lets in a nice breeze but makes one feel like a bit of an exhibitionist
on the left thats a doorwindow that looks into an alley
and anyone can look in
on the right in lotte department store there is a bathroom manager and worker
posh many buildings have bathroom attendants but here they not only have a checklist sheet as they have in the west in many places but also the picture of the attendant that cleans it i guess in case you want to pick them out of a crowd hey dont you clean my offices bathroom and in the one above there is a manager and attendant responsibile for the cleanliness of the washroom
if only they were at seoul station on line 4s i might not have almost lost my lunch
ah the monsoon season has ended and thus begins the dog days of summer on the peninsula
i promised myself that id never be in korea and especially in seoul for this but it looks like ill be here for about half of august
god it will be so hot
many koreans take this hot weather as an opportunity to take time off what with the continued fazing in of the 5day workweek here and have some ice cream there are so many awesome flavors here priced from 5001000 won or just 0
of course koreans have a penchant for doing the moderately illogical as well
today the owner of a hanbangsamgyetang extra healthy ginseng chicken soup place not this one but close came by the office
i actually was able to use my pitiful korean to confirm that his place is in the basement of some building and that the price was 8000 won 7usd not bad
then a friend of mine said it must be because we are in chobok or the start of the dog days
anyways as you may know koreans have 2 things they need in life to be warm and to be well fed
samgyetang is served literally boiling hot they even have special stoves to fire up the bowls so youd think its best served in the winter
koreans love it best in the summer as if its not hot enough
well this is korea so ill likely have a burning bowlfull at lunch with the throngs
when i asked why koreans like hot food in the summer the only response was because its good for your health
itll make the air conditioned office that much more inviting
oh and another reason they call it the dog days is they like to also have boshintang or dog soup
yup they eat dogs here read story if youve got a strong stomach
its the typical korean food reasons its good for mens stamina as in stamina between the sheets the only kind they care about and for womens skin gals here are a little preoccupied with good skin
many guys especially older ones and talents which is what they call any celebrity star singer actor dine on dog in order to excel in bed or in front of the camera
samsung has a new phone
with a three megapixel camera
lg and paniteccuritel have similar ones out as well
the only problem is the things are about 700000 won 600usd
so ill wait a bit until i get a new phonedica digital camera as they abbreviate it here
for now im having fun taking pictures of interesting things i see in this crazy place
it says 21 yangmalsan 5 gil or building 21 sock mountain area 5th road
building address in yeouido aka sock mountain
i asked my boss pictured below about why the heck a road is called sock mountain
it didnt make much sense even for this place
he told me that yeouido use to be called sock mountain
now the place is full of investment houses the national assembly parliamentsenatecapitol building and following the money bars and brothels
my boss mixing single malt scotch whisky and korean beer
the whole office went out last night for 507244421749332 ohgyupsal or 5layersofatpork
we have a new company member and true to korean form thats a great excuse to have food and a lot of drink
my boss please forgive him brought the bottle of 1950 macallan single malt scotch i got him on my last trip back and then oh my god i can hardly believe he did this proceeded to fill shot glasses with it and drop them in glasses of ob oriental brewery a local maltmaker lager
now my grandfather worked for seagrams and has scottish heritage and two of our suppliers are right from scotland and if they saw such a travesty they probably would have throttled himhence the pixelated face a little taste of the witness protection program tactics hell have to face for such an injustice to scotsmen everywhere
oh fyi only single malt whisky from scotland can call itself whisky minus the e all others are properly spelt whiskey
good thing i had my cameraphone at the ready to take these breathtaking shots eh
was entertaining a british friend of mine originally from manchester now in k
kuala lumpur who has basically been ruined by asia
you see once a western guy comes here he can hardly go back to life in the west
youll know if youre here
two other aussie brothers i know had the same thingthey both work for investment banks in seoul and shanghai and speak the respective languages to life is good for them too
same effect for korean women who go to places like vancouver they cant bear to leave that place either
anyways his business partner an aussie was in town with him too
so we went out for a few nights
also some american and a dutch friend of mine and some koreans wanted to go out too
and then a couple of nights for business
like i said been busy
we went to daehakro and had 49436545884604154028 seopidongpa seowest pipizza dongeast papajun a korean kind of omlette together they are western pizzaeastern omlette and 460414604151452 dongdongjua kind of immature makkoli or rice booze
the dongdongju it looks like porridge but tastes light the porridge look is actually ice crystals held in the mixture no idea how they make it so consistent
on the way out i almost invariably take the subway
its fast clean convenient and is unaffected by the recent torrential downpours its monsoontyphoon season here now
its interesting some stations are a little microcity with shopping areas some really large links to office and apartment buildings restaurants and almost everything else
they all have a few things in common lockers which i wondered about before but now ive used them a few times to store things i boughtand at about 1 a day theyre a pretty good deal payphones something you dont see a lot of overground washrooms some are better than others a lotto booth and usually a little convenience store gift shop flower shop andor food seller
amenities lockers pc bang escalators
i dont know why but many of the subway stops here are spruced up a bit
they have things like below lighted signs on the air conditioner units aquariums they call them fishbanks here and posters for the seoul subway corp
that show scenes totally unrelated to subway travel
subway art an air conditioner a fishbank and a seoul subway corp
poster theres also art shows sometimes
there was one for international childrens art this weekend at hyehwa station i saw 2 good ones one was from china and another one aptly named snow in canada was from my home country
a little piece of home
world childrens art china and canada thats it for now
man its been busy lately
out every night working here that means having drinks with friends clients suppliers and partners business partners that is im not into the girlfriend scene
thus all ive got today is a link to this other blog
some funny scenes from the seoul subway system
oh and as i reported earlier bricx bar had a bikini party last friday
i didnt make it there but here are some pics taken at it here and here
ok youre probably looking at that title and wondering what the heck the connection is
its tenuous but here goes
first these are four countries i likely will not drive in although i did drive in the philippines or phil but that was in my younger days the first three because of the amount of nuttiness ive either witnessed or assumed is there and the last one because i dont think id spend much time away from the beach
ok so about this korean driving stuff
ive been here for almost 2 years and always get the question do you have a car my answer i think is pretty logical
no because i the subway system here is cheap easy and pretty fast no traffic ii the bus system is not prefect but once you know which one to take its quite nice iii our firm has a driver and hyundai equus for visits on company business iv taxis are everywhere in this city and are pretty inexpensive v my work is like 20 meters from home and iv driving here is not like in canada either id cause an accident here or get used to this way and cause one when i drive back home
thus no need for a car
actually i try to stay off the roads whenever possible here
perhaps this is for good reason korea has one of the highest traffic fatality and injury record in the developeddeveloping world
take a look at these articles here and here and youll see what i mean
one reason is many koreans do not use seatbelts another article here
even i dont when im in the back seatespecially of a taxi
its really quite odd and scary that i always buckle up at home but take my life into my own hands when im here
perhaps simply because everyone does it here
people who do come here to drive have to get used to the rules of the road as described in this article from the u
and if you hit someone the driver is almost always at fault in some respect more on that here
so whats the connection to greece korean drivers licenses will be considered valid in greece
im not sure why it certainly isnt valid in canada you have to do a new test and everything there but for some reason greece has opened the doors for koreans to take to its streets probably because of the olympics
apparently greece is famous for some crazy driving as well
but then isnt that a brutal time for koreans or any foreigners to be tooling around town in a rental oh well im certainly not going to greece anytime soon and if i did id probably call george the supercabbie
i went there with a bud in december 1998 most of this file is classified so thisll be short
one of the highlights was driving from cebu city where ferdinand magellan was beheaded by king lapu lapu way back when to moalboal the noted diving spot
it was about a 3 hours trip on provincial read rural goatdogchildrickshawstrewn road and on the way back carlo was at the wheel
for some reason a dog was on the road and carlo tried to avoid it really he did swerve like 3 times the thing just changed direction again but in the end it became one with the rubber
also a kid jumped on the road and pointed a gun at us i hope it was a toy but you never know
with that i started to really question why id be at or near the wheel of a vehicle in phil or any other developing country
carlo and i returned to canada safely and got back to work at rbc dominion securities where we worked did i note that we started on the same day and had the same briefcase but within 2 years the both of us made moves to other firms
i was in canada a while longer before coming here and carlo went to first turks caicos islands then to cayman islands
he left then returned to rbc and as you can see from the pics below is an avid flagger i mean flag football player
ya he goes long on the field and goes short in the office
haha a little financehedge fund humor there for ya watch out carlo looks like that big dudes got your number good thing its flag football
right now hes player of the week way to go carlo his profile is here and his leagues site is here carlo why is the domain dot ky
oh and ladies too late he has a girlfriend and a baby on the way
lookin a little rotund there carlo
well thats the story from crazy driving to driving to the end zone in one blog
id like to thank my bud peter in vancouver for the picture below
it shows me that its not just koreans that are into voyeurism although the swiss version has oneway glass so people cant see in and the korean versions have none such discretion it seems
is it me or does she look like martha stewart and doesnt that look like a prison cell loo i was out last night on a hwishik which basically means a bender with guys from the office
we went to my favorite local haunt outsider
its called a playing bar in english but in korean they call it a yangjoo eebentba whiskey event bar
basically its not a room salon but its nicer than a regular hof or local korean pub
there are girls pouring the drinks but they are always on their side of the bar which is just fine by me
of course that wasnt all that we did
we had 3layer fat pork much like backbacon first and went to wa bar when you say the name it sounds like the korean for come here very apt methinks afterward
man i love living in yeouido
at least i can get home within 50 steps instead of taking a bus or cab for 2060 minutes to get home
sometimes i think im a little spoiled here
but then i remember the pollution long hours and compulsory drinking and i figure it about evens out
um wheres his other hand so anyways this morning i got out of bed at about 4am to do laundry wild and crazy guy that i am
i was still drunk obviously and ended up not checking my shirt pocket for the namecard thats what they call business cards here of the new guy the one on the left in the pic the middle guy yoon is our new recruit and the guy on the left is jolast nameby the way i think jo should have the english name of danny or daniel what do you think
well at least i know what he looks like
him yoon and i are all born in the same year but i am a few months older so we can be friends
its odd here even a year or so difference and youre considered on a different plane in some respects
so we have to take care of himget him plastered
the nice thing about being a little older is i can pull rank and make everyone drink
hahahaha but as a waygookin foreigner i can also claim to be untouchable in the good sense if i dont want to do something
hahahaha but i usually do it because its not a good idea to play the race card too much here
i had to get myself some coffee this morning but felt cheap as usual as there is wonderful maxim mocha gold sticks in the office
im sure these things are killing me slowly but theyre just sooo convenient also heard that starbucks just opened their 100th store in korea in itaewon actually
yesterday was its 5th anniversary in korea
and i remember when i first came here about 5 years ago actually they were just starting
in typical korean fashion they caught on like wildfire foreign expensive addictive
whats not to love one last thing
koreans have a special numbering system for counting things but they cant do the same in english it seems
they seem to think that th comes after every number
my namecards say that we are on the 2th floor
well were not the chigwa dentist is on the first floor
i saw an electronic device that was labeled 2rd cable port
at least they were trying on that one
last night i saw silmido
man it reminded me of the dirty dozen
the true story is the north sent a platoon 31 men of commandos to seoul in january 1968 to kill thenpresidentdictator park chung hee he was later assassinated by a cabinet member in 1979
their plan was thwarted but the south wanted revenge so they set up an ultrasecret crack team of 31 always have copy it seems of their own
but they didnt recruit from the general infantry or even the armed forces at all
the members of unit 684 as it was called were criminals on death row who they found out afterwards were already known as dead to the world and thus would not be missed if they failed or if they succeeded
the 31 went through extensive and brutal training on silmido silmi island but 31 real special forces members plus a commander
for 2 years they prepared themselves physically and mentally to slit the throat of kim ilsung the leader of nk at the time and father of the current dictator kim iljung
the time to leave and complete their mission came and they set out to pyongyang
but at the last moment it was cancelled
the minister of intelligence had changed and relations had thawed between the two koreas i wonder what catastrophe would have befallen this place if they had succeeded
with no reason to be unit 684 was to be terminated
the story goes on a ways from there and everyone knows it
which may have been the point of the south korean government
imagine if a foreign power and hated enemy sent a team to kill president bush or john major
how could they just let it go
but as in this case how could they let it happen this sacrificing of deathrow inmates makes sense from a political point of view
the south got to show that they were ready willing and able to go after kim ilsung but in the end it would have probably put the peninsula back in to a brutal and devastating war
silmido and the dirty dozen the true story is more unreal than fiction
at least the dirty dozen achieved their mission
but it was just a story maybe based on silmido who knows
yahoo finally after being in seoul for almost 2 years we closed our first deal
i had almost given up on this placemarket but looks like weve go our foot in the door
never give up is the motto here
reminds me of a client of mine i had in vancouver
i knew he was quite wealthy and invested in my area but it took 2 years to get an account out of him
he said to me three words ill never forget persistance beats resistance
man what a lesson that was
a friend of mine from geojedo cool blog about teaching experiences on geojedo here came up this weekend with a couple of buds from the island
one andy has a friend in concert promotion and they had 2 vip tickets to the mtv buzz asia concert sponsored by the supercool iriver companyarticle here at chamshil indoor stadium which i think is the same as the jamshil auxiliary stadium
thanks andy i had no idea it would be so packed
we got there just after 7pm when it started
we read the part on the ticket about first comefirst served but missed the line about doors will be open at 4pm
whoops koreans probably made a day out of it and came at noon knowing them
well the place was full but our vip friends were already in
the gal anne came out and owing to her sister who works with the prince tours showing her the tricks of the trade she not only got us into the stadium but into basically any seating area that wasnt already full
thanks anne the acts were pretty cool
we missed the first one boa but caught the rest
take a look at the pics below of boa jaurim and shinhwa
for all the boy bandsacts i tried to get the most masculine pictures i could for my site but if you want fruitier ones theyre all over their sites
i sometimes wonder about these guys but at least the girls are hot
boa jaurim and shinhwa
there were a few jpop and taiwanese acts too namie amuro vanness wu and wang lee hom
there were a couple of others but the names were in chinese and im feeling a little lazy now
namie amuri vanness wu and wang lee hom
so as you know koreans love to get together and eat and drink thats why the afterparty was so cool
it was in the ubertony area of apkujungdong
its home of the highest priced real estate and women in all of korea
yes im sure i saw many genuine fendi bags and plastic bodies
the best part was the 2 free drink tickets
ah theres the scot in me speaking again
the next day we hung out in lovely yeouido park another review here where we fed the birds below
it reminded me of the flocking to the afterpartybardancefloor the night before
birds of a feather and all that
the gatherings concert afterparty in the park
of koreans to the beach in pusan
i think the caption says there are 1000000 people there at the beach about 23 of the population of the vancouver area
i wouldnt put it past them
and my final comment on this topic credit cards
this article on how koreans were lured by the notion of easy moneycredit fanned somewhat by the card companies desire for market share at any cost and hwo it almost lead to suicide for these three individuals sadly many of also succeeded in passing on their debts to their heirs as happens here when a debtor dies
as promised yesterday last night i saw a korean horror movie bunshinsaba
first though there was time to kill before the movie so a little samgyupsal was in order
we went to don don restaurant in jongno downtown where there was an interesting concept
its on the fourth floor and is entirely openair
but they still had fans and air conditioners on full blast too
also the condiments ssamjang or bean paste sangchoo or lettuce miyokgook or kelp soup and other goodies that are handdelivered in most restaurants were selfservice after the initial placesetting
this was cool for me as i i love and with my pork and ii we were seated right next to the buffet
they also cut the pork right in front of you koreans are always trying to differentiate themselves especially regarding food
trouble is it kinda reminded me of lorena bobbit
dooough next stop was ice cream at lg25 lgs answer to 711
is it really open 25 hours a day and try my hand at shooting a gatling gun
not a real one mind you it shoots pellets
id like to see how my g
buddies do at that one
of course the place was staffed by 2 little korean gals all the better to lure in the men one of which was a pretty good shot with the beretta
cutting the pig shooting the gatling scaring the girls they say that fear for koreans is different from us westerners see article but i think it had many similarities to the western genre
although the setting and plot was a little different
i wont reveal too much but lets just say that the director did a good job of creating a lot of suspense and fright in that theatre
there was one gal there who went just berserk at about every scary scene especially in the beginning and everyone laughed after each outburst
i think she was scared enough for the whole room
without that comic relief it would have been a lot scarier i think
scenes from the movie
some pics above from the filmsorry figured out my zoom after the first couple and the lighting as you might imagine was not optimal
the effects were minimal compared to i robot but very very effective for this movie
afterward i took a picture of a lighted billboard
the girl in the white dress wasnt there when i took it
she must be a ghost ok thats a joke but it sure sounds scary
i came across this in my daily readings of korean news and sites
just trying to get a handle on this place
the antitraditional korean lady
holy crap they look strong and pushups more pics on the site its all in korean but no translation needed for the images
now i knew that korean women are strong in spirit but had not seen many like this
most korean men like their gals to be smaller weaker well most guys do its just more prevalent here so it takes real
balls for a gal to go into this sport
i dont mind it myself
maybe because even when musclebound korean women still look relatively daintyat least compared to their westernlady bodybuilding counterparts who start to look a little horsey
seoul is a pretty good place for outdoor activities as long as you live in the right part of town which i do thank you
there are a few parks around but 2 of the largest are olympic park a massive place that i lived near for 6 months when i stayed with my inlaws when i first came here
they were right in the 88 olympic village which was nice and yeouido park which was like a parking lot before they revamped it and added trees and stuff
view of yeouido core the park at 6am one spring morning
gorgeous the great king sejong and to top it off a guy sleeping in a gazebo
take a look at the scene above
this is like a block from my home and work
before the office moved to this side of the park these views were my commute everyday
a 12 minute walk from doortodoor
pretty cool eh sure it costs a bit more to live in yeouido and there isnt a lotte mart korean walmart to be found in the immediate area but its real nice here i think
the great king sejong is credited with inventing or at least causing the invention of hanguel the korean alphabet although its not really an alphabet its more a set of sounds put to writing
very scientific for back then
his name and image is all over the place especially at schools
there is also a book store and securities company named after him
and what stroll in seoul would be complete without seeing a guy sleeping on the ground or floor as reported before a few times
this guy looks prepared though
he had the presence of mind to bring a mummy sleeping bag and get himself in the gazebo and away from the earlymorning dew that is so prominent here in the spring
for exercise the little that i do here i like to inline skate as they call rollerblading here
take a look at these shots lg twins building 63 building and traffic heres the lovely lg twins building owned by lg group formerly lucky goldstar also owner of the lg twins baseball team there are rumored to be antiaircraft guns on the top of these towers to help defend seoul the 63story tall 50977493404871646377 yooksam 63 billding which houses 45824546204937347749 daehansengmyung korea life insurance aka kli by foreigners and a couple views of how close you can get to the traffic on this path
it actually goes under the 88 5403654036palpal highway for a ways
ya probably not the cleanest place to workout but its all we got without going 12 hours from here
many people actually drive 3060 minutes to get to here especially on the weekends and holidays when this place is a madhouse
on childrens day i got a groin injury from dragging my skate so much in order to slow down for the literally thousands of kids on the paths
and why exercise well there are a lot of fun places in seoul such as bricx click here to see the playboy party pics
man think i have to check this place out wet tshirts involved no minors and good ol ohoohodge podge some crowd pics here
going to see a korean horror movie tonight with subtitles should be interesting
man how do i come across some of this stuff
anyways there are a couple things that may help get my buds over to seoul sometime soon you know who you are
many have threatened to come here and some read my blog and may be on the verge but this should about do it
here it is seoul home of the sexiest women on the planet
not that they have a chance at meeting them but they are in the city limits apparently
theres also the interesting theme parties they have at bricx bar in itaewon
ive still never been to one but the last one the bikini party almost got me there
the next one is a jungle theme
ungabunga ok shes not korean
she may not even be in seoul
but its a mighty fine pic
of course if you do hook up with a korean especially a korean gal you may find yourself a victim of the coupling
ive heard its only with married couples but i suspect that boyfriends get roped into this look as well
4988852492 sinchon an area of seoul near 5486145824hongdae or the university district is a pretty cool place
from yeouido the subway is pretty inconvenient but theres is a bus that goes there and cabs are a cheap and fast option as well
a few times though especially in this warm weather i couldnt ignore the urge to walk the 45 minutes it takes to get therehome
its a nice walk flat across a bridge usually some nice breezes blowing by and you get to see more of the city and its people that way
smoggy view 2 black swans impenetrable lock stinky garbage peeeeyew the pics above are from a recent walk
the first is a lovely view of seouls smog
this is easterly to the west the sky was clean owing to the westtoeast winds from the west sea but it was too bright to take a picture of
below the bridge and fairly numerous along the hangang han river are 4817751312 swan boats
people paddle around in these things but not too often
the mascot of mapogu where sinchondong is is a swan youngdeungpoku where yeouidodong is has a duck sporting a necktie as its emblem
in the summer months people even sleep next to the river well not right next to it fishing eating ramen drinking soju talking
the odd spiral pic is that of a lock on a gate next to a dilapidated apartment building
you can see that not only is it easy to open but the material is nothing more than thin wire
i have no idea what or who this is supposed to guard against but i guess someone had a reason for putting it there
while walking back home i smelled something pretty putrid
then i stumbled upon the answer thankfully not literally this pile of decomposing trash
wheres a garbage truck when you need one actually i take that back
once in daehangro a garbage truck passed by and let me tell you the smell emanating from that thing was 100 times worse than a few bags on the street
worst thing was it came toward us and it left a lovely stenchridden trail of liquid behind it
fantastic if youre walking that way
i guess thats why the trashheaver was running so fast beside the truckhe wanted to stay ahead of the reek
anyways yesterday night my friend andreas friend travis came to seoul with his korean bridetobe 5478851221hyun jeong
we went to a korean tuna restaurant then to my outsider where he tried james dr
pepper 12 pint beer 12 pint coke 1 shot amaretto dropped in and downed in one shot and then it was off to sinchon for 493284520951648 sannakji living octopus and 49436545884604154028 seopidongpa a mix of western pizza and korean pajunomlette alone with 4954851452soju and 460414604151452dongdongju literally comes from the fermentation process where dongdongju settles to the bottom of the vat and is separated from a clear moonshinelike alcohol by a thin layer of rice
lets just say that we had a pretty good time and travis did quite well for a guy who doesnt drink too much not even a hangover the next morning
but then we got home pretty early at about midnight on a weekend wed likely had been out til 4 or 6 or 8 in the morning
forgot i had this in my phonecamera
actually got a series going of this dude at one of these dance video games
think i remember seeing them in vancouver too but this ones is not just feet but arms
there are lasers or something that sense where and how he moves his arms and if its in sync with the instructionsmusic
the guy was pretty thin and the moves made him look quite gay
i wonder if he does these kinds of actions on the dancefloor
i wouldnt if i were him the gals in the arcadegameroom were really laughing it up good thing the music was really loud
if this guys got all the moves why are the girls laughing so hard
there are a few ways to beat the heat here in seoul
one is to simply stay at work but with the governmentimposed 5day workweek coming into effect and since i cant really figure out why id work 7 days a week that isnt a very viable option
you could go to the beach but it tends to get a little crowded as this story attests
or you can go see movies
if you do though as i noted in a past blog get ready for some comedyand i mean before the movie starts
one of my favorite theatres is the brandnew fantaseum in daehangro
the staff there have some pretty wild costumes
there is a chippers restaurant on the top 2 floors too where apparently the food isnt so hot but theres a magic show to extertain the kids
the chippers staff even the guys have aprons and lace collars on their uniforms and the female theatre staff have get this wings
ya theyre dressed as angels
angels complete with wings and squid
the whole squid they also all have this cute well hilarious is more appropriate little salute they do when they greet you and say goodbye
they put their left hand on their hip their right hand up as if theyre swearing on a bible and touch their fingertips together while at the same time bending their knees
all this they do with a smile on their face
if you dont get my description think of a gay nazi doing a heil hitler and youll be pretty close
man the things people do for parttime work
oh ya the squid is there for general interest
ive seen dishes with hackedup squid in it but not one with what looks like at least a whole squid on the plate
anyhoo this weekend i saw 3 movies
one korean and two western ones not spaghetti westerns just nonkoreanforeign
the korean one was hyungnimdeului doshi mokponeunhanggooda or mokpo gangsters paradise
it was a pretty entertaining film although some korean humor im still trying to figure out
it goes from serious to amusing to gross in like 3 frames
one scene is with these 3 minor gangsters who are so poor they have to eat dogfood but it gives them the runs and later when you least expect it a serious scene cuts to them running into a singlestall public loo
well the senior guy goes in and prepares to blastoff so to speak but the seatcover falls and he lets loose on it instead of into the bowl
they show you the mess oozing from between the cover and his legs and even outside the stall where it envelopes the bare for some reason foot of his junior
my god is there anything more repugnant these guys were kind of a showstealer or a partypooper depending on your viewpoint
mokpo gangsters paradise king arthur i robot king arthur was
lots of action and killing and braveheartlike speeches but i can only give it a 3 or 3
if youve seen lord of the rings this one will seem kinda washed out
i did however find that one of the characters bors to be much like my bud from manchester alex
he also resembled alexs business partner mark but i met alex first so he gets top billing
reading about the actor ray winstone i learned that the character was much like the actor and both were like alex
life imitating art imitating life alex bors and mark
which is which i robot was pretty cool
i think i may have read part of the book way back in high school geek that i wasam
the movie had a ton of special effects in it but seeing as it was in the future they all made sense
things for some reason didnt seem over the top but that may be because ive been desensitized by now
i robot gets a 4 out of 5
or for those out there who are not into scifi a 3 out of 5
hey will smith is in it oh and the naked butt scenes are equal opportunity one of will but i closed my eyes for that one one of the girl but i told my wife i closed my eyes for that one
a pretty boring weekend for once
actually got all the sleep i needed for once
im sure i wont make that mistake again for a long time
ok its not at all scientific
i was just taking a look through my millions of jpegs and such and found these two to be well eerily similar
dprks kim jongil and u2s bono is it me or does north korea s democratic peoples republic of koreadprk dear leader look at least a bit like u2 s bono of course they have some pretty different ideas about human rights and the environment but i get the feeling that being in the public eye for so long the throngs of adoring fans well in kims case adoring may be a stretch and accompanying entourageroadies may have made them both a little distant from workaday realities
at least bono doesnt require visitors to put flowers at the foot of massive statues of his father though
heres an interesting story thats sure to attract an obliquelyworded press release from the north
just in time for mel gibsons the paparazzi movie here is a candid shot of tommy from 54616452084616849483hanadoolset 123 fame its tommy actually hes on the snippetshow wakeup where he and a korean girl and a lovable muppetlike friend say simple phrases again and again and again
all to the same music everytime
im cccooooolllld i tape it every morning for my kids back home and try to learn a bit of korean
everyone speaks so relatively slowly on the show and uses simple tenses which is good for us gringos
it was pretty funny seeing him
it was at starbucks in sinchon and i immediately recognized him well seeing him everyday with his twotone hair makes him an easy mark
i was waiting for a bud and he was with a gal so i didnt intrude
but i did intrude enough to take this pic
i was going to approach him but then i thought it weird to act like a fan for a guy whos on a kids simple english program but im sure if my friend showed up before he left id have done something
ill probably hear from his lawyers soon anyways on account of the pic
its tough to make out that its actually him so i doubt any of the local rags would give me much for it
there goes my dream of paying for my trip home with a snapshot
there are so many celebrities in seoul especially in yeouido as the mbc and kbs broadcasting firms are located here
when i went to that party after the mtv concert my friends said they saw lots of talents singers comedians actors anyone in the limelight but i hadnt a clue who they were
one time i was in the gym with my 51109510645061247480jangeeneoruenfatherinlaw and he introduced me to this guy while we were in the shower
he looked quite familiar but given the surroundings i couldnt quite place him
he was the anchorman from kbs news now hes the washington dc correspondent
theres also a popular comic performing in a bar in yeouido i think hes a partowner of the place but i had no idea until my junior from work told me he got his autograph too
on another unrelated topic remember when i said that foreigners are buying up korean companies well looks like theyve bought about 44 of the stocks on the korean stock exchange
wow can you say takeover what would happen if americans bought large swathes of canadian companies oh ya they already have
anyways some koreans are calling foul forgetting that you cant have capitalism without capital
the craziest idea is the one to levy a tax on the investing funds
as soon as that gets serious many foreignersll just sell preemptively and pull the rug out from many of the firms not to mention the economy here
of course thered be calls to prohibit capital from leaving korea as there was in the park chung hee era 19611979 when emigrants could only take about 20 with them when they left the countryalthough im sure that didnt apply to governmenttypes
that kind of thinking would put korea about 1020 back from where it is which is in many areas 515 years back from the west
that was close almost sounded political there
just so you know i dont make this blog a sounding board for my political views however when it comes to economics and business i think i have a relatively educated and experienced opinion
so be prepared to be bored or aroused depending on your view of the dismal science every once in a while
man with all that is going on i can see my posting to the ol blog getting bogged down the next couple of week
got a ton of stuff to do at work as well as the trip at which time ill be in fulldaddy mode for the duration which means precious little time to blog
well well see how much i can relate to you from canada
in the meantime take a look at shawns blog
hes got some funny stuff to say usually although lately hes been a little infatuated with taking pictures of his chubby bod for those of you who know
we have similar body types
take a look at this article about changing the age of majority from 20 already a year younger than the u
to 19 the same as british columbia canada but higher than the 18 that is prevalen federally and in some canadian provinces
here parents are commenting on the ability to take on rights and responsibilities at the tender age of 19
my boy is almost an adult now and the law now even considers him a man but he has to learn his responsibilities and accept his own choices in life han hosun mother of a 20yearold said
but what does he know he is not ready to make decisions as an adult yet
and if he is granted too much freedom im worried hell get himself into trouble
other parents of young adults agreed
they nodded their heads to the idea that the government before lowering the adult age should provide training and programs to teach what adult responsibilities entail such as building up a good credit record making political decisions and getting married
what 19 years kids that age arent really mature enough to handle anything let alone complete adulthood said one parent who asked for anonymity
the first two seem pretty sensible but the last one if the name wasnt withheld would be prime fodder for the tonight shows headlines segment i think
then theres this article about the capture of an exconvict suspected of stabbing to death two police offices a few days ago
this part deserves special attention as police raided the house lee injured himself by stabbing his abdomen and thighs several times while holding a child and a 48yearold woman as hostages to resist arrest
he was immediately sent to ehwa womans university mokdong hospital for emergency treatment
what did i just read that right the suspect stabbed himself enough to need to go to the emergency room what was he trying to do commit suicide so as to evade capture methink perhaps the can i say vengeful police on the scene may have helped him guide the knife just a bit
maybe he did stab himself but it sure seems weird
heres an oped on the capture and how it was handled by the police
ya im off to canadavancouver again soon
ah to be back in the land of fresh air real mountains and diapers
luckily i think my oldest boy is out pottytrained now
not sure though havent been home for about 2 months
and a lot can happen in that time
now that weve done a deal here my bossceo would have me here all of august well all of the year actually but i have to go back as its my younger sons first birthday or chotdol they have a different name for almost everything here
for koreans the 1st and 60th birthdays are the biggies
1st because the child made it through the oftentreacherous first year remember korea used to be really really poor
so much so that is was a 100days celebration as well but that is starting to become less important as more babies are living past it
60th because the korean zodiac is similar to the chinese one
with 12 animals ya im a pig
there are also five colors which elude me at the moment although i know two of them are black and gold
the chinese use five elements metal earth wood fire and water
this year is year of the wood monkey which i guess is better than 1981
year of the wood cockrooster
hehe had to put that in there
anyways at age 60 youve gone through all 12 years 5 times for each of the colorselements
a truly magical time i guess
thus by age 60 men no mention of women should have at least one grandchild preferably a grandsonone more reason to be happy that we had our oldest boy in my wifes fathers 60th year now about foreingers as iwe call all nonkoreans
even in canada for some reason
korea aint called the hermit kingdom for nothin
basically there are very very few foreigners here
something like 200000 in a country of 48 million
most of us are like me in seoul and not like me teachers
others are manual labour workers from china india and southeast asia doing the 3ddirty dangerous difficultjobs that koreans feel they no longer need to perform en mass
foreigners or weigookin or weigooksaram are treated quite differently from native koreans and likely for good reason in some cases
we all need to register with our local ku wardborough office and do so i every 12 months or ii if we move to another whichever comes first
we get an alien registration card that has our pic and address on it as well as our visa type teachers are e2 i fall under e7 or other worker director
we need the arc to get a job get a bank account or do almost everything else official here
but its not the same as a korean citizenship card
some promotions for example the bonus card for fantaseum is only for koreans not me
so i cant get 10 off movies or get bonus points there
waaaaaaaaa also foreigners cannot easily buy land in korea although ive also heard that it just cant be done
not sure who to believe on this
foreign investment companies however still did so and did in great amounts after the 1997 financial crisis
in fact they were the first firms in korea to ever use due diligenceresearch before buying and developing land
korean execs it seems did it based more on intuition than anything else before then
its also hard for foreign firms to get market share hereunless they partner with a local firm such as otis did with lg group concerning elevators and escalators
heck foreign car makers have just 3 of the local market not counting gms recent purchase of daewoo motors which is a small player anyways
one thing foreigners have had some success in doing is buying all or parts of troubled korean companies
korean firms put off foreign investment as long as possible but in the end they can take on foreign investors daehan sengmyunglife aka korea life insurance is 5 owned by australias largest bank macquarie bank
korean firms however are loathe it seems to disclose what most purchasers would consider to be important facts about the businesses
kyobo sengmyunglife apparently had months of due diligence done on it by buyout firms but in the end not enough was known to do a deal
foreign firms have been able to buy billions of usd in korean stocks sk life large portions of korean banks other firms and one pca is in the running to buy daehan tooja jeunkwondaehan itcinvestment trust company aka daetoo names here can get pretty long and complicated though so there is some opening up of this place
funny the longer im here the more normal all of this seems
not sure that is a good thing
someone else i know is coming here from canada for a visit
first was my cousin lars in may of 2003
he came at the perfect time
weather was getting warm but not unbearably hot and childrens day and buddhas birthday were celebrated day off during his time here too
here are some pics from his visit
we did almost everything you could as a tourist for a short visit but light on the bar scene as i was not as educated as i am now on it
and he was so young and impressionable at the time
you must have sars seoul city hall traffic square myoungdong on the weekend kids and wooden swords korean heritage museum us at the korean folk village on the bus heading to incheon airport
he had a fever from a normal cold a few days before he got here so that and the general lack on english language ability by almost everyone here lead him to be delayed getting out of the airport by over an hour
next time ill give my visitors a little note in korean to show the airport staff saying im a top gamer from please make sure i dont miss my tournament and speed me through customs quickly
or some such thingkoreans love their online games here they even have a tv station dedicated to it
lars had this to report about korea and hes flown about 1000000 miles thus far its similar to europe but just lots more people
the second person was a guy i met through a teacher in pusanbusan i know through a friend of mine in nanaimo my old roommate actually funny how things seem to dovetail as we get on in years
anyways her sisters bud is getting married to a gal in taegudaegu and wanted some pointers on how to not screwup in front of the inlawstobe
he was here for a week or so and in seoul for a couple of days
but i think we crammed a week of drinking into one night
yusheng should have a good time here and should be here sometime in the fall date to be determined
the guys some kinda world traveler and he takes some pretty cool pic of architecture wherever he goes
ive noticed that many of them are devoid of human presence
something hed be challenged to do in seoul
theres always people around you here no matter the time or place
if you want to see some cool shots of my other hometown vancouver take a look here
ok time to get my pubmaps out and plan yushengs course
i think if im going to claim yeouido as my new hometown i should know something about it
and by extension you should too
ive got a little more to add to my background on it thus far
as you may know do can mean two things in korean
one is province such as kyunggido
the other is island such as jejudo also spelled chejudo depending on what era the map or publication was edited in
things changed in 2002 just in time to confuse the heck out of tourists coming here for the world cup
since yeouido also spelled youido yoido and yeoido is pretty tiny and part of youngdeungpoku ku is like a ward or borough such as queens or the bronx the do here signifies that its an island
i had no idea that its do was island because it looks as though theyve filled in or paved over much of the water that once separated yeouido from the mainland
anyways way back when yeouido used to be on the outskirts of seoul and it housed the countries first real airport
later gimpokimpo airport was built in the new outskirts of seoul and now since the city is not getting any smaller incheon airport is the new international airport for seoul although kimpo still handles much of the domestic traffic
in fact yeouido park which until 1996 or so was a slab of pavement instead of the picturesque park that it is was the runway of that airport so here in west yeouido near the park is where the streets are named yangmalsan or sock mountain
i got to thinking why it would be called sock mountain
there wasnt a sock factory here to my knowledge and i hadnt heard a story about removing ones socks for any reason although i wouldnt dismiss it if i heard it there are so many different traditions here
when i heard about the airport i came up with this theory sock mountain is the hill here they call a mountain what we in vancouver would call a knoll i find where the windsock was placed
make sense for more exciting and groundbreaking news stay tuned to this blog
being gay in korea is like being gay in the u
lets just say that its not near as lovingly embraced as in the westus
gays marrying in korea cmon there are no korean gays of course if one is gay one can hardly be korean
im not trying to piss of pcers out there this is just the way many koreans especially men and older ones think
although the younger generation are more open to other ideas its the older generation that controls politics education finance and even media and culture to a large degree
the ceos of the tv stations are all men and all old guys as an example
things are changing though as evidenced in this poster for a gay bar in itaewon
now that you know its name you can either i know where to go or ii know where to avoid depending on your preference
yikes here are a few websites on gays in korea here and here
this blog has a tongueincheek explanation of what being gay is
basically a primer in gaydar how to recognize a gay in korea or elsewhere
however i think that many of the guys here have gay characteristics
in a business meeting one guy from a partner firm put his hand on my leg just above the knee as he spoke of my experience in finance and what i do for the investment process
this would be outrightly gay but in korea its ok
it just shows nonsexual fondness and a measure of trust between two people
my boss does it also
much to the surprise of foreigners in our group
but again its not gay its just the culture here
my wifes uncle holds my hand too
and not for 23 seconds for 23 minutes
at first i thought it was pretty weird but it just means that he really likes me
having said all this i know ill have to put up with a deluge of gay jokes when i see my buds back in canada crap
over here guys touch guys and girls touch girls but its just not sexual
many young gals especially can be seen holding hands while walking down the road
add to that the schoolgirl uniform and you have a formula for stimulation for most western guys
you get used to it though
i really wonder about some of these korean guys though
the face shop has a model on all of their makeup stores thats pretty gay looking
there are others as well
these guys are i hope more metrosexual than homosexual although the distinction is greying
many of the boy bands have similar dudes in themthe clothes the hair the dance moves
i got to really wonder sometimes
remember this guy perhaps because of the stigma attached to being gay in korea most gays dont come out of the closetchoosing instead to marry have kids and be a normal person or going into singing or acting or modeling and making the excuse that theyre too busy with their career to find a wife
either way its quite different from in the west where there is more acceptance of such things
on another topic yesterday i had lunch with my ceoboss and he mentioned that china and korea were having a tiff about the gorguyeo dynasty
he said oh how can you know about that
it is just korean history
well when i said that is was about 50ad600ad and was concurrent with the paekche and shilla empires and before the united shilla dynasty that preceded the closelynamed koryo dynasty of about 11001300ad that was right before the venerated chosun dynasty of 13921910 he just looked at me
not sure if he got all of what i said but a colleague dining with us said that i do in fact know about korean history
hey ive been here almost 2 yearsand not all of it has been in the bars
my dates of koryo are a little off but if you want more information of where korea came from take a look at this site
it has a cool timeline
just right if youre writing a report so if youre speaking with a korean dont be surprised if they assume that since youre a foreigner you cant know precisely anything about koreaand if you do know some facts or stories from its history you can really impress them well here
oh and just for the record im not gay
o optimist p pessimist my argument with myself p nooooo stop thinking about him o why hes my boyfriend
p youre obsessing o what no im not
i just like him a lot
p youre crazy if you think its going to work o ok
then im crazy p so you think it will work out between you two do you think hes the one o yes and possibly
p insane i cant believe you you know what is going to happen the same thing that always happens
you will get your hopes up and then he will drop you flat on your face o he would never do that not in a million years p what makes you think that o hes different
p how so every guy youve ever met has hurt you in some way and he is a guy
right o of course he is a guy p so how do you know he wont break your heart too
p oh my gosh i dont know why you are doing this to yourself again
now look into my eyes as i gaze aimlessly into yours
i know you can see it all
we lock each other in a stare trying to freeze us in this moment
a conversation passes between us but no words are spoken
unsure of what to do next i run my fingers through your hair
this position once so odd now becomes the most comforting thing in my entire world
once it was my savior and now i am betrayed by the bell
we stand hand in hand as the world goes on around us
i tell you i love you
i walk away only twenty steps away
i look back to see you watching me
i run back and kiss you
when we part and walk away the warmth remains on our lips
you take with you a huge part of my life
not only do you have my entire heart you have my first kiss too
remember me fondly forever because i will never forget you
i walk into the only entrance of my prison
school once was my escape but now my confinement
we are but ruthless animals in a cage
the rules here are almost amusing
no permanent marker no writing on clothing no cameras
so for these last few days of jr
high we cant take pictures outrageous am i supposed to remember everything i have no clear images of these last moments with my dearest friends
just foggy memories continuously fading
we have virtually three days left of school and now the teachers are piling stuff on us
last minute projects are popping out of nowhere but on to of that we have to deal with the pain of saying goodbye
im not even strong enough to face one of those problems by myself let alone all of them
why do i like him hes funny we have so much in common he is so cute we have the same sick mind he likes friends i know huh unlike other guys he can actually match he is super sweet never is he mad he is intelligent he is open almost
ok hes blunt he is witty he is not gay see not all the good ones are and yes ladys he is real
i dunno why hes with me
i didnt think hed like a girl well
i mean im not to brighti almost get streight fs im fat im ugly im a bitch sometimes im clinicly insane no
realy that seems like a lot to deal with dont you think i dont know what the boy sees in me
but this is like a dream come true
every girl dreams that some day the perfect guy will show up one day even a girl like me
i guess theres hope after all
even for a girl like me
ive fallen so deep so fast
i dont know what to do with myself
but i know i feel so good
i love to look at him listen to the voice of the aries
i wish i had the courage to go up to him and kiss him
i want to but yet fade away into the shadows of fear and questioning
dose aries like me how can i tell what if he doesnt and im making a fool of myself stumbling over my feelings
a little girl with a crush just out of her reach
what if he dose like me too if he asks me out do i say yes of course i do even though we will not see eachother as much as wed like who says it cant work right
but what if it wont work
i guess well have to find out
its hard to think that we have less than a week together
most of my friends will fly away together leaving me without wings
aimlessly hobbling around trying to find replacement wings and friends
i almost dont want to go to school
i dont want to say good bye
we can say well be friends forever but the truth is no matter how much you hate to admitt it people grow appart
high school is the hardest most crusal part of anyones life and im left to face it without my sheild my crutches my wings
as every body stands up in high school still hand in hand walking together helping eachother i wander holding my own hand being crushed and stepped on by the clans of friends
no friends no passion no will to live
never have i stayed in one school for more than two years
so every other year i am forced to start over
this is like the others but different
this is more important to me than anything else
i cant start over again
mabey ill be invisable never get into another relationship again
i know it will just shatter like the rest
i cant stand to be hurt one more time
i cant pick up the shards of my broken heart alone anymore
but i have no choice
some people say the future depends on you but really you depend on the future
so im depending on the future
that tomarrow will be a better day
i will be optomistic and spend as much time as i can with my friends for i only have a short time with them
untill june 9th 2004 320pm then its
stroke my face thats resting on your lap
tell me itll be ok
tell me we will be together forever
tell me you love me youll never forget me
well still see each other all the time
look into my eyes with your sympathetic eyes
no stop youre lieing ill never see you again everything will be different you dont love me you wont returne my calls youll forget my name stop go back to the week before we are all together in washington d
you are together i am alone
stroke my face thats resting on your lap
tell me its ok to cry
you may be wondering why my site is called spaghetti wall
it is a joke between me and some friends
we went on the washington d
we were at a nice italian restraunt and i got plain spaghetti noodles
one of my friends pointed out that if the noodles were cooked theyd stick to the wall
she grabbed a handful and sure enough the spaghetti stuck to the wall for some reason i couldnt pick the noodles off the wall with my fingers
i couldnt get a hold of them
what else could i do i ate the spaghetti of the wall everybody though it was so funny do you remember the spaghetti wall
i walk into a life long summer memory that i havent seen for two years
the buildings the people even the attitude of the whole place are the same
i love the fact that year after year i can depend on it to be its old comforting place
i feel like im in a dream
i know every face i see even the parents but i fear they dont remember me
i fear im just a confusingly familiar face
ive changed so much from last time theyve seen me up till now
i wonder if they can see that
i am curious to find out if how i am now will effect the way i function in this place differently than before
i walk into this life long summer memory fading into a new reality
youve been through every season of my sole and you still love me
you have always been there for me
youve never backed away no matter how unbearable the weather was
its hard to find people loyal enough to go through with that
im just lucky i guess
the seasons of my sole summer when everything is doing well
my life is going smoothly
no bumps in the road
fall when my colors fall off
unlike a leaf i dont float down i crash down hard
winter when the rain starts to fall
my life is completely torn to peaces
winter is the harshest of all seasons
spring when my life starts anew
i gather myself and often use you for support im very weak at this point
my life begins to blossom
i work at a day camp full of little kids
you wouldnt believe the stories ive heard from these kids ive heard that someone could detach his head and still live for reals
this one kid was born with flames painted on his fingernails its amazing how many kids still fall for the detaching finger trick
its interesting to think that to them this is all so real
while to us it all seems so fake and ignorant
im beginning to wonder if what seems to be reality to me is as fake to someone else as those kids to me
what if what they believe is real is the actual reality and what i believe is reality is the huge made up story
i look about this old memory i am now reliving and everything from the writing on the wall to the paint job to the people is exactly the same with the exception of a few oddballs
i love the constancy of this beloved place is something i know i can rely on
i love the respect i get from everyone and the old summer friends are my continuous invitation to keep coming back
what you are about to read is a quick write
a quick write is an activity we did in my eighth grade english class
our teacher gives us a topic to write about
we get a generally short time limit to write as much as we can about this topic keeping it as legible as we can
in this quick write the topic was my best friend
we were to describe our best friend or if you didnt have one you could write about what your best friend would be like
my best friend would be a great person perfect in my eyes
hed be easy to talk to
hed always listen and hed be great at giving advice
i wouldnt be afraid to tell him my deepest darkest secrets id know he would keep them
he would not be judgmental
my best friend would never ask why i am the way i am or why i do the things i do he would already know
he would be extremely intelligent
i would never have to explain myself to him hed simply accept everything
he would never be bitter at me for my wrong doings but would always praise me for the things i do right
hed be the only one with an unconditional love for me
he would never play favorites hed treat everyone as equals
above all my best friend would be a christian a healthy christian who was very close to god
hed be my best friend
it was not until when i read it aloud to my mother when i noticed i chose my best friend to be male
then she pointed out that every time the nameless friend was mentioned i had capitalized the pronoun
thats pretty uncommon in the english language unless of course you are referring to god or jesus
read the quick write again
doesnt it seem to describe godjesus
you think youve known yourself forever and will know yourself forever until you change
the truth is you dont truly know yourself
for you are wearing a mask a thousand masks
and you never really change you just remove one mask knowing another is beneath it
yourself is your biggest most well kept secret of all times
the only time you can ever reveal your secret is in you dreams
in your dreams all your masks are stripped from you
you see how you truly are
but when you awake you forget your dreams yourself your hidden identity
you put on your thousand masks so just incase one falls off you can never be seen
and you step into a world of masked people
you step into a masked world
have you ever felt so horrible like a million knifes stabbing your body all at once
the pain is imbedded in you
not only physically but mentally too
it seeps deeper opening every wound in you not yet completely healed
the knives penetrate through your entire body and sloe
all pain physical and mental becomes one thing
the process to heal such a great wound could take more than a lifetime
death seems so relieving right now
but then you just freeze
you cant think but thoughts are racing through your mind
you cant speak but you have so much to say
you cant move but you just cant stay still
you slip into a conscious coma
a stage of literal nothingness with a numb pain
thats not fair i work with a ton of little kids so this statement is too well known
my response is usually lifes not fair
one night after a completely unfair day i thought about it
i thought about how you could explain lifes not fair
i decided to take a religious stand on this subject
i came up with this if life was supposed to be fair wed all go to hell
do you think its fair that the most perfect man who never sinned in his entire life was tortured and killed for our sins and wrongdoings but if life was fair jesus would not have died for us therefore we would not be saved
we would not have a chance to go to heaven
so yes lifes not fair but it was never meant to be
some people say its not where you are going that matters its the journey on the way
this may be true for some however there are those who see it through my eyes
what if you know the journey is so rough so unbearable and you know you just might not be able to make it through
do you be an optimist and lie to yourself tell yourself it will be great and easy only to let yourself down time and time again i dont
that is why i believe you should live for the destination the utopia beyond the hardships
what sense dose it make to live for the harsh path it makes much more sense to live for the tranquility that awaits you on the other side of it all
journey harsh sharp painful unbearable rough intolerable agonizing excruciating awful insufferable horrendous insupportable violent ruthless fierce vicious emotional anguish suffering destination utopia tranquil calm serene peaceful relaxing bliss soothing relief perfect soft constant lovely wonderful paradise which one do you want to live for the journey or the destination
death can be a scary thing
it only seems like that because we know so little about it
we dont know when our decease will take place or where for that matter or what is after death although there are many opinions
everybody is different so i can only speak for myself but death to me is in fact daunting
im not really frightened of how i die it doesnt matter that much to me
im not apprehensive about what happens to me after death i believe my god will take me to heaven
im afraid of when i will die
im afraid that when i die the people who i know would never have heard what i had to tell them especially my family
im afraid that id pass before i told them i loved them so much
i couldnt imagine their lives after i died without having a clear conscience that i loved them
id think they would think of my last memory of them trying to remember if it was a positive memory
nobody wants to be remembered pessimistically
i want them all to know that i appreciate them all so much and i love them with all my heart
i love the natural high i get from dancing
my movement is so limitless
every emotion can be told through dance
i cant even begin to explain the rush i get from dancing
i dont care what other people think
i dont care what i look like or what im doing
i become so incredibly care free
i am never free from stress anymore
im constantly working and am always stressed out
i can never get a break but when im dancing i stop thinking
everything lifts from my shoulders
there is absolutely nothing on my mind when im dancing and i get light headed and dizzy
when i need to escape i turn on the radio and wait for a good song to come on
then i dance until i can hardly move anymore
everything is forced from me
no more anger anxiety depression stress ect
people are always saying just be yourself
when you say i dont know how to act in this situation they always say just be yourself
but what if yourself i mean the way you truly are when no one is watching it not what they wanted or expected
you are constantly rejected for yourself
how would anybody attain friends or a significant other certainly not by being you
so according to the surrounding people be it at home at church with your friends you put on an act to satisfy their wants in a person
like a chameleon you change your colors attitudes style personality completely change yourself to match and blend in to your surroundings
so when people say just be yourself think about it
they are really saying look act be how i want you to be
have you ever had the feeling you were alone even though the whole world is surrounding you they arent really with you at all
i was sitting next to my best friend and her boyfriend who at that time was my crush
i look down at their hands holding each others hands
i look down at my hands holding nobodys but my own
as i was walking to my next class with my arms crossed i saw them again
this time they were hugging
again i look at myself to see that i was in fact hugging nobody but myself
i really shouldnt feel so alone but for some unknown reason i do
it is painful being alone and all
but i know theres someone out there for me too
actually i knew there was someone out there for me until i met my love
there is nobody that could compare to him
until fate breaks us apart which we both know will happen soon im not alone
for once im not alone
im new to this can you tell god how do i create a links column
election time has rolled around again
and everyone is spitting their venom at each other in hopes of impressing the public with their tact
instead of pointing your greedy little fingers and accusing mr so and so why dont you do one better and tell us what youre going to do for us
im sick of hearing what he did how badly they did it or how they didnt but should have
i guess it isnt like anyone is bound to believe anything you white collared putzs have to say anywya
you always do the opposite
ive been trying to educate myself on the different political platforms to figure out which i can identify with most
personally for some i think lying would gather more votes
shit no wonder the libertarians never make it into office
to blatantly state we should eliminate the entire social welfare system
this includes eliminating afdc food stamps subsidized housing and all the rest
individuals who are unable to fully support themselves and their families through the job market must once again learn to rely on supportive family church community or private charity to bridge the gap
oh you thought that was it theres more the bulk of your welfare tax dollars goes to pay the handsome salaries of welleducated welfare workers
the poor get little from government welfare except meager handouts and a cycle of despair
ummmm what so let me get this right
government should stop paying the meager handouts to families in need and instead have those families go begging churches and charities for even smaller handouts
those meager handouts are causing the moneywell to go dry but hey its ok to throw cash at foreign countries and help their people out
who cares that most of them deteste the united states and somewhere in their hearts pray for our annihilation
i bet those little bastards setting our flag on fire and stomping all over it after 911 arent aware that our money covered their birth
nothing better than paying for the future of terrorism
maybe im taking this personally as i should
because without the ever so popular welfare system
my mother and myself might have suffered
i can see you all thinking that your precious greens have in some way helped me become the fine young woman i am today
the sum of monies my mother received could be accounted for with taxes paid out from my immediate family alone
she could have been on welfare for another 20 years and technically taxes paid by my extended families would have covered it
so ill just thank them and give you the middle finger for being arrogant enough to think that you have had any impact on my families financial prosperity
and now the shoe is on the other foot or however it goes and my taxes are paying for your sistersmothersbestfriendsbrothernieces illegitimate kids
and to ease your silent curiousity my mother is now a very successful businesswoman
so suck my tampon string
here is another liberal issue surely the cure to the nations healtcare and war on drugs
lets just legalise it its typical of the liberal party to promote the legalisation of drugs isnt it
i mean for their stance on issues alone they have to be smoking or snorting something
the liberals take on anything seems to be we cant control it so lets just legalise it and save ourselves the time and money it would take to correct it
if you see it that way youre a plain idiot
does rehabiliation not cost money do damages not cost money ok give some kid easy access to some pot so they can fall asleep at the wheel and crash into a building
individuals have the right to decide for themselves what to put in their bodies so long as they take responsibility for their actions
ok well when these users are irresponsible and their actions endanger other people
then what let me guess have their parents bear the responsibility
addicts out of control were a tiny minority
and food is legal i can almost picture it
1972 after a demonstration on public sex and the art of smoking pot through your girlfriends vagina a group of teenage dropouts were arrested and spent a night in jail where they concocted this notion that if everything were legalised the standard of their living would be improved and fuck consequences of drug induced peoples fuck work performance fuck cost of consequences fuck everyone else
and the liberal party was formed

and the book were readin is quite good birdsong by sebastian faulks
a few months later on his next visit he took isabelle for a walk in the garden and told her that he was being posted abroad and that he was not in a position to continue their friendship
he skated round the question of marriage with pleas of poverty and unworthiness
isabelle didnt care whether he married her or not but when he said he would not see her again she felt the simple agony of bereavement like a child whose only source of love has gone
for three years her loss coloured every moment of her day
when at last it became bearable it was still like a wound on which the skin would not thicken so the least thing could reopen it
the reckless innocence of her unguided childhood was finished but eventually a sweetness and balance in her nature returned
this section stands out to me
the book has yet to mention war actually lol but a very steamy and by the womans description very satisfying scene she was choking with passion for him but he frightened her
she wanted to comfort him but also to be taken by him to be used by him
hmm i like this book lol newas gota go watch the match sarah xxx

nbsp grr hav a pic called wind
wrote this dont ask me whynbspbut takin me ages to put it onto the pic wind she wandered down the cold stone steps wind whistling through the thick air causing her wispy hair to flutter about her face like black silk scarves in a teasing dance
foriegn leaves skittered after her pushing her further away from their familiar habitat chasing her to the border of her own world
falling to her inexorable melancholy bareexistance
shed like to see the arrow splintered in his pulse shed like to see his eyes flood with lies
sucking bleeding watching you gasping
a little smile plays upon her lips her eyes excitedly wide they narrow again as her fingers step to a lament only she can hear echoing throughout her hollow mind
entrapt in this bitter wind
kneeling down in the dirt one long nail traces a symbol
lifting a blue teardrop from beneath small lashes its blessed
rising dizzy with energy she falters regains control she holds the chains now
she binds and sways the wind to her desire encircling her til she cannot breathe
shell take your breath with her instead
nbsp blah blah blah skins herself n hangs it up to dry take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green n the girls are pretty wow i hav so much to say xbwx nbsp

go to school disturbed angel beautifully decayed
met lim this morning then we went to spc to get help from raymond
cos theres a maths quiz coming up and our lecturer is damn boring
seriously yesterday was the very first time i really can listen and pay attention during maths with minimal distraction
went to tp in the afternoon with janice and mandy
studed in the library till it close
badminton at 5pm tp sports hall
i only managed to do little stuff at tp cos i cant study outside
headed for tm after that
went ntuc to buy fruits and bars
then janice didnt allow me to go home
so accompanied her to yamaha
she wanna buy a new guitar
i found out that im the shortest girl in my class
had very healthy food today
i shall not mention what they are
cos i cant be bothered to do so right now
as usual theo and i played with food
todays creation consisted of usa waffle ice cream hersheys choc syrup qoo lemon ice kachang maple syrup chilli sauce butter tomato ketchup
we did something worse after that
theo poured the solution into roys drink can
during lesson we were still crapping
only the other half of the class the rest of the girls were paying attention and doing their work seriously
the rest of us were gave stupid answers all the time
the thing is we were seated right in front of the teachers table
after sch limwilsontheo and i went to ikea
lim wanted to go there to buy toys for dunno what reason
we went there for hot dog first
theo and i shared one cos both of us scared fat
then we played with all the sauce
this time the mixture was nice
went to walk after that
then after that wilson suddenly appeared behind us
went to tm with theo and wilsonnbspafter that
kept laughing on the mrt
theo kept imitaing and making fun of hofm n geokeng
wilson went to arcade to play while waiting for his friend
theo and i went to walk
after that i went home and he went to orchard
tml still can play with food
cos we got one and half hr break
met up with limwilsonroy and theo for breakfast at mac
i insisted want to go mac cos wanted to play with food
theo and i played with all the sauce
mix honeybuttersugarcoffeematetomato ketchupchilli saucecoffeemilo and tartar sauce together
fun but just gotta bear with the smell on our fingers after that
so fun to play with food
17 years old already still play
so childish rite the worst thing is that theo blow bubble into the disgusting mixture using straw
after school roylimwilsonmekeithnicholasaddison and valerie went to sakae at harbourfront
too bad theo didnt want to come along at the last minute otherwise we can really play with food
lim was perfectly normal today which is quite unusual
shed been nutsto the power of infinity for the past two days
giggles is very alert despite her age
her lecture was damn boring that theo and i started to write messages but she noticed us
nbsp the teachers din bother to stop us from eating sweets in class
its against the rule to eat in class
but who cares rite rules are meant to be brokenquote mandy
todays lunch was on addison mr rich man
went to pizza hut for lunch
the meal totalled up to about 59
its not a problem to him cos hes so rich and 60 is nothing to his father
wilson and jerren ate like gluttons as usual
wonder what happened to them theo and i played with the leftover food
mixing everything together till it smelled horrid
jerren took a pic of the disgusting creation lim cant be bothered
the state of the leftover food is gonna be worse tml
see where we go first
basically leftover food will never be in good state when tampered with creative people like me
we didnt do uwos tutorial 3 for homework cos we din know that its supposed to be done
theodore and i brought our neoprints and prom pics today
hes really very fat when he was in sec sch and also looks very different
now he so ai mei
but im still fat as i always am
lim and i laughed when we saw his pic
oh ya our noodle family was formed today

cos of his size lim called him noodle
then theo named the rest of us
jerrenbee hoon wilsonmee sua theomee hoon kuay steph yapyu mian steph limee mian roymeepok
he named the remaining girls fishball fishcake tau gay tau kua tau pok and cockel
wahahaha our tbcm teacher was called ban mian cos of her hair
very mean rite but nvm
basically were crapping the whole day
see the tbcm teacher already can laugh
but theo kept making me laugh during dbms
observe the teachers eyes and the way she speaks then imitate not his fault la
we gotta have eye contact with the teacher when lessons are going on
theo imitates the way she pops her eye popyoureye
p lims damn hyper today
kept on talking and making noise nonstop since the time we met in the morning till the end of school
she accidentally caused wilson to drop jerrens hp on the floor till it was dismantled into a million partitions
but miraculously the hp din go bonkers its such a fun day except for dbms prac

quite boring as had a long day
everything was boring except dbms prac
priscilla asked a question in the bible study material how do you confess your sin i was very sleepy and bored so an answer came to my mind
and of course i shared my answer
step 1 commit a sin
without a sin how can you ever confess step 2 do some reflection about the sin
step 3 confess and you shall be forgiven
common sense answer right no sin how to confess so must commit a sin in order to confess
i was very satisfied with my meals today

so boring rite actually got morning call
but i was too sleepy
cos i didnt want to sleep yesterday even though i was really really tired
i got ways to keep myself awake just to sit through boring lectures
half a can of coffee every morning before class starts will do the trick
theres school for me tml
dun have to stay at home
can see my friends and play and crap
well i hate to start off no such a sour note but things havent been going so great with me lately and heres the dirty
well my job i work as a quality assurance tester isnt that great and theyve been laying people off left and right at my job
i just found out today that this one guy got the axe a few weeks ago but was told that his last day will be sometime in october can you imagine being told that you arent an asset to the corporation but that they want to hold on to you for two more months i couldnt imagine it myself
aside from that everything with my boyfriend and i arent going that well
he just seems to never really hear me
hes always so defensive and he never wants to be wrong
he can say somethng that he doesnt like about me but then when i say the littlest negative thing about him hes all defensive and saying oh why do you switch it and make me look like im the bad person come on give me a break
ive seen him 5 times in the last three weeks but he sees nothing wrong with that
i mean people that live in different states see there loved one more then i see mines
and then to add fuel to the fire i found out that im the victim of credit card fraud
i cant believe the asshole only left me with 20 on my credit card thank god i have others and thank god i dont have to pay for what i didnt use
then my girlfriend whom ive known since high school is having a baby so me and two of her childhood friends along with her brother are throwing her a shower
well at least we thought that we were
my girlfriend sent us information about what she would like for her party but one of the girls is taking matters into her own hands
she replied to my friends message telling her that she need to mention anything because we have it covered
then she sends out the so called party committee an email and here are some excerpt from it 1
her favorite color and because its a boy she and i decided the shower has a red theme
she just told me in an email red and white and now she is looking for yellow but since i am in charge of decorations i fell confident we can stick to our original color theme
id we have to use an additional color thats cool no one shohuld break their necks but white on red not red on white which is totally diffferent
i mean seriousl i dont thin that the whole red theme is suitable for a baby shower
i agree more with the yellow
there will be kids there as well so i just think that it should be somethng that would appeal both to adult and children
it is a baby shower for crying out loud
we will have red theme drinks and decoration
no cartoon prints like blues clues disney etc
for example she likes this giraffe that is yellow with red spots he id not famous she just seen it somewhere
this baby shower has more of a sophisticated dinner party feel as opposesd to a traditional baby shower feel
we will have red roses as the center pieces instead of one of those baby shower things
are you kidding me a sophisticated dinner party we have to serve the people appetizers on trays
am i playing servent for the night or what can i sit and enjoy the day with my friend i dont understand why you want a dinner party instead of a baby shower and on top of that theres not dj we the party commiteess that is has to make a mix cd each i mean why have a party committee if one person is making all the decisions well on a better note im sooo excited about this coming weekend
my girlfriends and i are going to six flags
i havent been out there since i was about 12 which has been to long
i was a weedy child
this wasnt so much an accident of physiology more an unnecessary attempt by the world to fully cast me in the role of maths geek
of course at that age i wasnt of a mind to worry but eventually i decided that i was hideous
there is one particular family holiday where all the photos have me hiding in the shadows for fear of nothing less than being seen
and then i grew up a little and found out that whilst i would never be very well built so to speak i had quietly grown to a respectable height amongst my peers
i started putting more stock not in how i looked but how i carried myself i started losing my clumsiness
and now whilst im still not much to look at my body ususlly does what i ask of it what i need it to
i got comfortable with myself i accepted what i was never going to be
although i could never be a nudist and for two very good reasons i the cold and ii my need for pockets
and did i mention the cold i generally have lots of things in my pockets i find it is one of the better things about mens clothes there is no line to ruin as such
so i feel if naturism was to become compulsory id need some sort of utility belt
and a nipple piercing to stop me losing my keys obviously but firstly a utility belt
being naked is no excuse for not having a grappling hook handy
i have developed a pain in my chest that is quite worrying whether it has arisen from an almost entirely carbohydratebased diet or from overstretching during an impromptu kata is unclear the fact that it is making it harder to sleep is undeniable
although certain claims on my snoring would seem to indicate otherwise
add to this the effects of returning to training after an extended bout of laziness and we have a recipe for why i am only just surfacing now to eat the chocolate muffin left for me
i hope the pain goes away being the paranoid type is never easy at these times
also in light of the amount of dwontime ive been having its a medical observation that the longer you stay in bed past the normal eight hours or so the greater your chances of having a stroke
well i think its funny
almost five months to the day of living here i realise i do not own a canopener
this can be interpreted as a good sign i dont live off canned food or a bad sign i live on toast toast doesnt come in cans
plans for today call evil car hire firm call nonevil laura eat nonevil food pay evil credit card bill maybe even go outside the world is my nonevil lobster
i have been given a book to read one that will change the way i think
praise indeed although i find that expectation often leads to a greater chance of disappointment
the inscription however is touching neil never forget just how awesome you are some days i dont feel so awesome
after drinking a mixture of lagers and the sweet tonic of white russian the idea of toast is more appealing than during everyday life
and yet the night was set to get so much better than that buttered toast
dont take my word for it go and try it yourself inebriation optional
we had to go to the shops for more bread because we ran out
more evidence that making do with what you have is more than just a way of living it is essential for progress
the sun has temporarily graced us with its return and the freeflowing air of outside this room is calling
also i have a friend who i suspect may need help eating that tub of ice cream
hugs squizzer toast and gravy gargantuan paul the postal service slaps hay fever n
it is never good to start on a digression
however a digression you know those conversations that go something along these lines youre in a weird mood
yes you are whats wrong im not in a weird mood dont shout at me i hate those
so to the point patriotism
in specific reference to the england football team being knocked out of whatever tournament it is thats on at the moment this evening
it was an exciting match but im glad that england lost
note i didnt say we
and why because those eleven men playing football out there arent doing it for me they dont know me i dont know them i didnt ask them to play football for me
in no way do they represent me and certainly not as a result of them being from the same country as me
but i mustnt go on so
blogger food of the day uncle bens express rice
genius it comes in a packet that stands up in your microwave it takes two minutes you dont have to refrigerate it and its quite tasty
especially at one in the morning when youre all toasted out
hugs alex and her talk of bra shopping uncle bens express rice staplers a bit random i know but they are cool arent they space raiders crisps ten pence bargain the manchester cow parade slaps indigestion from eating toast and rice too quickly sheesh
and no im not in a mood
is getting up at five in the afternoon more acceptable if you went to bed at five in the morning i hope so
the good thing about midsummer away from the equator is that the sky never really gets very dark especially in the sodium orange pool of greater manchester

the discussion of kung fu techniques that interlaced our drinking was quite illuminating how shotokan karate shares similar traits with shaolin not counterintuitive but enlightening to actually see in practice and how multiple punchblock techniques are somewhat pointless

we are drinking and talking of unrequited love
in a moment of clarity i looked up the tablature for tightrope by the stone roses
a truly beautiful wonderful song and one that i have every intention of playing at some point when the mysterious band gets together
acoustic singalongs were never so cool are we etched in stone or just scratched in the sand waiting for the waves to come and reclaim the land and then in a moment of complete insanity i looked up the tablature for good times by the stone roses
why delusions of adequacy and nothing more
oh my good god there is no way i will ever ever learn to play that
aside i probably could but it would need to be a fulltime job and im fairly sure noones going to pay me for that alas
i get as far as 026 and then its into the main riff and ive no space to fit all those notes in
it brings up the issue of the second coming though which is a vastly underrated album in my opinion
to have those two completely different songs next to each other and to have it work is an indication of something even if five years is a long time to wait
definitely worth having good summer guitar tunes
disregarding the rain that is
interesting fact on the set of 24 hour party people i met the fake john squire that is the actor playing john squire in the film

an incident yesterday when a girl i was talking to on messenger clicked accept for webcam feed before realising that she wasnt actually wearing a top
her modesty and my fun was saved by an uncompromising norton popup that has increasingly more to answer for
the rain is as insistent as it is unwelcome not to mention inappropriate for this time of year
good weather for the following hot chocolate writing songs staying inside shaving okay not shaving but i do need to
also washing where do all my pants go its a mystery
as this blog unfolds im sure my master plans plural what master plan would be complete without at least one foolproof contingency will become clear but for now i must go and busy myself with the ongoing preliminary stages

and whilst giggling is good one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier
finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business we stopped to examine an officesupplies catalogue that had arrived in the post
who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime not i for certain
i list but a few buy 36 permanent marker pens get a stunt kite
buy 30 lever arch files get a barbecue
buy 600 plastic wallets get a crate of diet coke
buy 3 boxes of pilot hitechpont pens get an inflatable basketball set
buy 4 boxes of manila envelopes get a gazebo
a gazebo the message here is clear forget what you think you know the world is far weirder than you thought
especially in the realm of office supplies
five in the afternoon is not a good time to be eating breakfast
that there is something wrong is not in question what exactly that is is proving elusive
im fairly sure i wouldnt mind so much if my dreams were anything to write about but they are mostly fairly horrible and occasionally as was the case just now end on a musical number featuring julie walters
further involvement with local politics the disassembling and analysis of a certain incident of assault has strengthened my conviction that people can knob off that is to say that being emotional has never been an excuse for being wrong
of course the real crux of the issue is that one week after passing my second dan i missed the only real fight thats ever happened here

hiya i have some observations id like to share like how sometimes it seems easier to go out of your way for people you dont know and how once you start ignoring the phone it becomes easier and easier not to ever pick it up
in recent stealth missions i acquired a popcorn maker a neat little device that is essentially a hairdrier with a funnel attached
the heat makes the air difficult to breathe in but the snacks are worth it especially now with my newlyacquired bottle of maple syrup

a gift today in the post some cds and a charming card from a friend who recently stayed with me
a delightful girl whom i only met last sunday but she needed a place to stay and what the heck what i lack in judgement of character i make up in hope that deep down people are nice
how foolish and so to bed
nbsp but solitaire is a lonely mans game
nbsp abstraction is a wonderful skill it not only allows me to separate my higher functions and so see myself as i the notation becomes tricky see other people but also allows me to effectively ignore the world
nbsp other theories and observations that i intend to share are mainly statistical in nature i am forever intrigued at the difference between the individual case and the ensemble outlook
so much of the world is chaotic and yet the word itself defines the world as completely and rigorously deterministic
but even this is statistical the macroscopic newtonian world is merely an ensemble of the quantum level where chaos is replaced by true uncertainty
and yet things fall downwards and they always will
nbsp i am fascinated by the notion of bringing order from disorder matt ridley is keen to point out that humans and living creaturesnbspin general are merely localised anomalies of order in a world overrun by entropy and the second law of thermodynamics
i am reminded of the startling man lennart green a card magician extraordinaire
this is a man that can have a deck of cards shuffled and will then restore the entire order suits and values without you noticing
it is astounding i saw him do it at a lecture once and i was impressed
i learned the theory of how to do it i was more impressed
this brings me to my favourite current way of wasting time spider solitaire
here we have an unending supply of disorder waiting to be ordered
and when you win you click yes and there are yet more cards to sort
lucky im not the obsessive type eh bugger nbsp still the idea of patterns and order is one that i feel is worth exploring
it is my contention that we understand things simply because we recognise the patterns involved
this generally comes from experience learning to see by interpreting repeating patterns of light as objects for example and so when faced with the unrecognisable we want to understand the logic of the pattern
if we are able to recognise familiar patterns in everything then we understand everything but onlynbspin terms of what we already knew
if we strive to form and learn new patterns with every new experience then we understand everything but with nothing in relation to anything else
the true skill then is to recognise both the familiar and the familiar in anything new what of this have i felt before what of this have i never felt before nbsp i am rambling
i shall leave you with a list and then be off to play solitaire

nbsp in my head and in response to an email i received discussing the separation of beauty and personality i have compiled a top five list of girls i have been most attracted to
this list was much harder to make and im still only up to four
at presentnbspand in alphabetical order it runs ceri charlotte chloe helen nbsp the crucial point though is that none of the previous list appear here
the above were all girls i have been lucky enough to get to know well whereas the previous list is made up more of acquaintances exceptions are my sister and caroline
i leave you to make your own conclusion do the above people appear more attractive because i know them well ornbspdid i get to know them well because i firstly found them attractive do the two go hand in hand because you will get to know people more if their personality fits yours and thus you will also tend to find them more attractive disclaimer i have no intention of upsetting anyone i would be the first to concede that my opinions on many things are a little skewed and i would urge anyone to remember that my notion of attractiveness is often in direct conflict with other peoples
there is precisely no worldly advantage in being found attractive by me unless younbspfindnbspme attractive in return
and how often does that happen nbsp so anyway todays scheduled laundry was postponed for the duration of the magnificent seven a wonderful film that i force on unsuspecting people from time to time
whilst it will cast me out of certain circles i will have to confess to never having seen the seven samurai although i do like the kurosawa i have seen
my favourite quote from the film is yul brynners response to the idea that farmers tell their women that the gunslingers will rape them well we might
in my opinion though you could have given us the benefit of the doubt
the dialogue throughout the film is brilliantly measured i should like to write characters like that
nbsp ongoing arguments with my mother struggle to keep within the boudaries of reason she avoids the issue of whether she believes me essentially anything i say ever despite my asking the question directly at least four times
i know the answer is no from everything else she says but i still want to hear her say it
i can disprove all of her assumptions but she does not care for that
and in line with all the things my therapy is uncovering she demands of me that i suppress my own character
i have no desire to do that maybe when i was young but no more
when she starting telling me i didnt care inbspundoubtedly did but these days my answer is tempered by the turbulence in my own mind over who i actually am
personality conflicts with conditioning and the problem lies in that whatever shaped me has made me into someone who needs to question the validity of those implemented ideals
i cannot respect you if you lie to me and i cannot trust you if you yourself do not recognise that you lie
like i say ongoing issues
but apparently they arent important
nbsp i should also like to apologise to anyone who overheard my attempt at playing the piano this evening
a long december never sounded so long im sure
nbsp aside you know youve done well with your lunch when the stacked sandwiches are as tall as they are wide
as i sit planning yes planning what to write i am torn as to what my actual aim is if i am diverting then that is more than good enough but surely i have something more to share to this end i will attempt from time to timenbspto expound on some of the theories i have formed about how things work
if nothing else it will be a useful insight to the way my mind works and how i perceive the world
the first that comes to mind is leapfrogging buses or how to not get infuriated on your way home
more on that innbspa minute
nbsp hold your thumb and first finger out very close together

yes now that is how close i was to buying a polaroid instamatic camera on thursday
i saw one two actually but one appeared to date from the paeleolithic era and wouldnt have looked out of place with a pinhole in a charity shop and spent a good five minutes toying with the idea
ive always wanted one that i can remember something about the selfcontainment appeals to me
but i didnt buy it in the end out of respect for my everdire financial situation camera cheap film expensive and also the thought that i may be mistaken for someone taking candid nudge nudge wink wink say no more squire photos at home
a label i wouldnt mind so much if it was a remote possibility but sadly not
todays list is of things that are not really fruit but can be classed as one of the days five portions since they are healthy a glass of milk vitamin supplement pill opening a window taking the stairs thinking about having some fruit its true you know it is
nbsp leapfrogging buses a theory
more of an observation really
some simplifying assumptions i all buses travel the same route at the same driving speed
ii all passengers are travelling to the end of the line
iii all distributions are normal
iv there are no priceticket considerations in choosing buses
v all stops are the same duration
thesenbspwill be dismissed in turn but to illustrate the idea ivenbspstarted it as simple as possible imagine there are people waiting for the bus at every stop
one bus travelling the route will stop at every stop to pick people up and take a certain amount of time to do the run
this is obvious but more interesting is if there are two buses travelling next to each other
assuming i to be valid as is the case on my way tofrom work people will signal for the first bus which will stop
assuming ii to be valid the second bus will not stop and will overtake the first
the buses have now swapped positions and will leapfrog each other down the route stopping at every other stop and thusnbspcompleting the runnbspfaster
however buses tend not to set off together it makes no business sense
but if iii is valid then there will be a statistical variation on the number of people waiting for the bus at any stop at any time
in truth the variation is not truly random but follows a certain pattern rush hour etc with an amount of variation builtin
and if there is a variation then we can say that v is not valid
nbspso if we are to imagine there is at a certain stop at a certain time significantly more people than the mean number of people at any stop at any timewhich is statistically very likely then the solitary bus will be signalled and will have a long stop for everyone to board
this will delay that particular bus and the next bus along the route will gain some time on it
a feedback loop is created the first bus is taking longer to do the run since its stops are longer this leads to a greater buildup of people at the following stops and will cause those stops to be longer also
the second bus may not encounter the same heavy numbers of passengers and so will gain on the first bus moreso as the first bus is continuing to make longer and longer stops
eventually the second bus will catch up and the two will begin to leapfrog
nbsp so we have leapfrogging buses if these are running faster than a single bus would then it is conceivable is it not that the two would eventually catch up with any single bus ahead on the same route bingo three buses in a row
assumption iv need not be discussed heavily since people will either simply signal the first bus that comes along which is statistically more likely to be a first bus of a preleapfrogging pair thus not affecting the leapfrogging behaviournbspor will have a ticket for a certain busnbspcompany which modifies the idea from being any bus to buses of a certain company treating each company separately
whilst assumption ii is not valid in the general case it does not affect the behaviour in the long run
also required is the possibility of there being no people waiting at the stop all the possibilities of first bussecond bus stopping are thus yesyes no distanceorder change between buses yesno decrease in distance between buses possible leapfrogging noyes increase in distance between buses no leapfrogging nononbspnbspno distanceorder change between buses if all these occur randomly then their overall effect is that described earlier to promote leapfrogging
nbsp and there we have it my idea as to why particularly at peak times where it is more likely that there are people at each stop buses can bunch up in twos and threes
i have no idea if this has been postulated anywhere else i certainly havent looked for it
but do let me know what you think or if i dont make sense somewhere which is quite likely
anyhow im making chop suey
nbsp i leave the room for ten minutes and when i come back the radio is playing club tropicana
this sort of behavior must not be tolerated i have urgently restored hate by the delgados to the cd player

nbsp the train company wrote to me againthey say theyre very sorry my train was late setting off late arriving and was without lighting and heating for about a third of the journey
the thing that gets me is that theyre not even doing it deliberately to make me laugh theyre actually serious
if i only had a car
oh wait i do have a car
i just cant afford the insurance
and why because its about three times as much as the car is worth
without any noclaims bonuses i cant afford the first year premiums and thus will never get any noclaims bonuses
and heres the thing if you are insured and you have a crash they put your premiums up its like theyre saying ah yes well we didnt think youd actually crash
we were just taking money off you if you want to crash then thatll be extra
nbsp from the bus today i saw anna i was tempted to get off and run back to talk to her but i figured my life has enough complications and anyway last time i saw her about three weeks ago we were on the same bus and i saw her and i think she saw me but either she didnt recognise me or wanted to appear as if she didnt
im putting it down to my then outrageous hair i have too many issues to explore the more likely scenarios
nbsp the five prettiest girls i have ever known in some sort of particular order my sister on her wedding day pink laura clare slater anna ball caroline rogers i make no claims on personality or overall attractiveness just prettiness
it is worth noting that i have only been out with one of them caroline before anyone starts and that whilst at one point i may have ended up sharing a house with laura i never actually knew her surname
it is also worth noting that they are all very lovely people easy to get on with and intelligent
i guess this goes to underline that its nigh impossible to truly separate personality and prettiness
nbsp and alsonbspnaomi tan almost made the list
nbsp man the delgados rule
i love the british railway system who else would write to you to let you know they are going to write to you maybe i should write back dear sir thank you for your letter warning me of your impending letter i was however startled to receive said advance letter without prior notice

although maybe im just bitter that soon i wont be considered a young person and will have to forge my railcard
is it just me or is there no waynbspanyone in their right mind wouldnbspever considernbsppaying the full fare id want a piece of the train for that amount the seat at least

nbsp my woody allen cd has arrived and has much funniness contained it still sounds fresh despite being recorded forty years ago
i find that people treat woody allen in the same way as karate bear with me on this one they seem to have formed an opinion without having actually sampled any first hand
and so my mission shall be to play woody allen to all my friends and if they dont like it ill kick them in the face

nbsp i am wondering whether the inclusion of links to stuff would enhance or detract from this blog that was one of the problems with my old journal
people started getting clever and being clever is the original doubleedged sword
given the choice between being a popular jumpingoff point or an obscure idiosyncratic i choose the latter
mind you thats not to say you cant combine the two i direct you to greg nbspboth as a good example of such and as a hattipping to the guy who got me started here
oh and i meant to say everythings going to be alright
quotes of the day there should be more good stuff everywhere
riley you look like youve got more toes than i have
let me introduce you to a place ive heard of a place that does not exist
here the rules of causality can be circumvented
consequence still follows action but is no longer inextricably linked the two can be separated
we can pay for our mistakes at our convenience so as not to cause unnecessary suffering
i was first introduced to this place by a dear friend of mine who uses a love story as illustration
i keep the details deliberately vague
a boy has been with a girl for many years and meets another girl whilst living abroad and falls in love
but it is an unknown love the love of a few months knowing someone
and the question becomes is the chance of this one new person being the one if there is such a thing statistics dictate otherwise but hey worth the irrepairable damage that will undoubtedly happen to the existing relationship his answer as i think most peoples would be was no
but wouldnt you like to know have the freedom to explore that possibility without having to hurt anyone this is possible here
your mistakes are yours to make and they will not inadvertantly destroy anyone elses happiness
like so many things it probably wouldnt work but its a nice thought experiment
on conditional love i cant really be doing with it
i think i should rather be loved because i have earned that love because i am worth being loved
my body and mind are a statistical genetic result and as such it is an accident that i am me
any number of different people could have resulted
even if conception is deliberate as is not often the case then to be contractually obliged as a parent to love the offspring regardless of their character is absolving the child of the responsibility to try to be a decent person and absolving the parents of the responsibility to try and raise the child to be so
a responsibility i believe everyone should have to try at least
it is my noblest and most human characteristic that i do not consider myself to be enough this is the only thing that ever pushes me to be more than i was than i am
there is a sign in the window of the local hairdressers that says models required
firstly it occurred to me to respond to the advert surely there is money to be made for a young lad with a passable face and a willingness to submit his hair to the whim of fashion and then secondly i had a much better idea i shall hang my own of these notices in my window and see what comes of it
i am so much more content with real people capable of conversing and where necessary cutting me down
girls with charm are welcome models need not apply
i just liked the thought of it thats all
i am watching films recommended to me by my therapist

in my lifei have been guilty of many things and innocent of many also
my wonder at the world is matched easily by my cynicism and yet the one everpersistent feature is fascination with the sensation of living
it is fair to say i have never felt anything like it
recently spending time with ceri reminds me of the fervour with which she embraces life and the way with her i couldnt help but do the same
i try to remember that when the time requires it
a downbeat post my apologies
and it started so well
i often find that this is the way things happen
although to be fair often the other way too
well look its like this
i find haircuts traumatic possibly moreso than most things in my life
if that sounds odd consider this
i have never ever in my life received a haircut that i was happy with
i am twenty five having been alive for a quarter of a century how many haircuts do you suppose i have had how many have you had i havent liked a single one of them
haircuts are traumatic before you get anywhere near the hairdressers it begins with people starting to tell you to get your hair cut or more likely just making snide comments at the expansiveness of your mane
so then you decide to get it cut and things get serious
what cut do you want how do you want to appear to the rest of the world i hate the idea of stepping out of the shop and declaring yes i paid money to look this specific way
and why do i hate that idea i pay money to dress the way i do to go the places i do so whats the difference ah good question and the answer is one of lifes little secrets hairdressers never do what you ask them to
they only ever do what they were going to anyway
it makes no matter what you say to them you will only ever leave the shop when they are happy that you look like they want you to
we are helpless once our hair is cut from our heads gravity takes over and we never get it back
we are at the mercy of the hairdresser someone youll note who invariably has hair that you personally wouldnt be seen dead with
strange that eh yes its true whatever you ask for youre leaving looking trendy
or even worse as happened to me last time having an interview the next day i asked to look sensible
i actually came out looking like i was in the marines
and then of course we do the quitenessentially british thing of remarking oh yes thats fine thank you when asked if the cut is alright
and then we pay them when we would rather stab them in the eye with a fork
is it a thing with hairdressers that given their job is to cut hair they just keep going well past the point they should stop when i get my hair cut i indicate how much i would like taken off and then they generally confirm by doing the hairthroughthefingers thing
i become optimistic they have obviously understood
so then they cut the right amount off all over my head and i am content
and then for no reason that i can gather other than perhaps making more work for themselves they do it all again
i cannot adequately describe how genuinely depressed i get after going to the hairdressers
i sit there as they cut and with every snip i cant help but think well there goes another four weeks dedicated hairgrowing
and then i leave and my neck gets cold
i hate it so much
when i graduated i paid a lot of money for a special graduation haircut my attempt at ensuring looking nice for posterity
i went to town literally not figuratively although i suppose the phrase came from somewhere
i paid double the price i would normally expect
i could have saved the extra money i could have bought a pizza
even talking about it makes me sad and angry
maybe i should refuse to pay
maybe i should start out by explaining exactly what i want and letting them know i intend not to pay if they cut my hair too short
they always cut my hair too short
maybe i should stop them half way through
i knew i should have cut it myself
i knew it i knew it i knew it
no toaster let nature do all the hard work a nice crispiness to bread can be achieved by simply placing the bread on a plate out in the open for several hours before consumption

of the two main bus companies that operate the route i use i recently changed allegiances on the grounds of a cheaper weekly ticket and the observation that there seems to be more of that type of bus

but there have been certain words and actions the effects of which i have understated that have thrown me into confusion again
and worse i am no longer sure of even recording these thoughts here for fear of the audience i have become aware of
a sad thing to live in fear to take anothers game so seriously
i did what you asked i would have hoped that would be enough
i am curious to know what you were thinking and i am almost sure im entitled to an explanation
i think i could maybe ask but consider this you so often have proved me wrong in what i think the question regrettably becomes more complicated
you think i overreact i am amazed i am so calm
if something doesnt matter to you then you must concede you are probably the poorer judge of how it should be handled the morning is well upon me
i think i will go and have a conversation with the memory of you before sleep and daylight successively save me
i have cracked spider solitaire
last week i came up with a method of defeating it and i havent lost a game since
some are taking a long time and are decidely tricky but ive completed every single one
now everyone knows i normally only do the medium difficulty one but today i tried a game on the hard setting
convinced i guess the first thing to note is that unlike conventional solitaire every frame can be beaten
an obvious statement perhaps but important i think
i developed the idea on the twosuit variety and i havent done it rigorously but i hope youll get the idea
i always keep a spare cell when you can
this is the most useful space since anything can be put there
always work to be making a new spare cell the more the better
ii keep a track on colour or suit changes the less the better
always use a spare cell to swap out matching suits if you can
before a new row fill the spare cells to give lesser numbers of changes in the board
iii clean runs of the same suit can be treated as a single card runs of different suits are therefore broken down into that many single cards
iv if you have many of one card value then try to keep them exposed as little as possible by not moving nonrunning cards on top of them
v using two free spaces simple runs of different suits can be moved using the tower of hanoi principle
vi completing a suit and removing it can never be a bad thing since it does not alter the ratio of unmatched useful and unuseful cards
vii stacking up suitchanging runs isnt a bad thing it helps to free spare cells which are more useful in the end
it is common on the medium setting to be able to complete two suits before needing the first new row using this idea
but most importantly and the key to the whole issue is that you have to remove the element of chance from the game
if you rely on luck there is a good chance you will be beaten
if you want to beat the game every time you have to sacrifice the honour of playing an honest game
it is up to you whether you consider this worthwhile or in the spirit of the game i started doing it to investigate whether each frame is possible
it is possible that each frame is possible in a number of ways but im not sure how to show this
i call this the riley method and basically it means being ruthless and never giving up
the key to this is the undo function
if something doesnt look like its working out go back
you can undo back to the last suitremoval or new row and often youll need to try a few different approaches
mostly the objective is to complete another suit but beware that this can scupper you if youve filled all the spare cells so be careful
overall then i cant say this will guarantee you success
ive been playing cards since i was little and ive built up a good understanding of cardplay and i have a fairly mathematical brain to start with
but i thought id mention it if only to explain what ive been doing with my time
id be interested to hear any comments anyone has and again i havent looked to see if anyone has written about this before i prefer working the puzzle myself
list of puzzles i that i looked up the answer for the morris sequence my favourite sequence puzzle ever rubiks clock well lee dicks told me because hes an arrogant bastard but id showed no signs of getting the answer myself there are probably others
no let me put it differently
made so by the presence of a certain scouser that has been decidedly missing from my life of late
whilst the reunion wasnt everything id hoped for i do concede that sometimes clothes are necessary
a trip to liverpool brings back many memories all of them good and adds many more besides
promises to go again soon are much less than idle i assure you
returning to manchester on saturday with alex in hand so to speak we are able to catch up on months of pointless chattering which is always good
having to fulfil a promise i made a long time ago under duress im sure i dug out the magic box and did some tricks the reaction i got makes me wonder why i ever gave it up
well maybe i didnt really
just a change of emphasis
i couldnt help but be amused that the patter was all still there in my head maybe my childhood wasnt so wasted after all
some of the shows we did completely daft but theyve got to be some of my favourite times
those days we were indestructible we could do anything so we did
not such a bad way of living
they say that you can have too much of a good thing and the takeaway pizza almost had the better of me but i outwitted it in the end
with the intention of getting horrendously drunk we then proceeded to get dressed for the night out i put some shoes on whilst maria and alex proceeded to try everything on twice straighten their hair i idly did a bit of my fringe but succeeded only in looking like i was from franz ferdinand put contact lenses in and lord knows what else i wasnt allowed in the room no matter how nicely i asked
turns out that the two of them are exactly the same size in clothes which is both convenient and a little worrying
apparently they got ready in remarkably quick time
any concerns i had about it getting too late for us to become entirely inebriated were soon put to rest with our arrival at kro bar where we swiftly ordered the strawberry beer wed been looking forward to
finding ceri and some assorted chemists also at the bar was a bonus and with the addition of gargantuan paul made a decent eight
and there we stayed until closing whereupon we sauntered to the inestimably groovy big hands
ceris admirable figure and sharp eyes getting us entry discount and a table respectively it all worked out very well indeed
as we proceeded to drink and shoot the distinct lack of breeze and on the promise of some frankly lewd behaviour yet to materialise i should have got it written down dammit i repeated the elastic band trick a couple of times
the principle of never repating a trick can be bent slightly with the addition of alcohol i find
discussions of kung fu and swaying to the sounds of manu chao give way to me being told that i am gay because i know cats cradle
hmmm and you think theyd be impressed that you could do it with elastic bands
and so into the night air and bus rides addressing urgent questions are we going to bed now or are we not not
instead we are to go to marias to collect wine and for paul to steal stella from the fridge leaving four pounds and the note have nicked your stella buy yourself a palace and to go ssssh very loudly before back to mine to talk about
well anyway it was good
sunday morning is true studenthood a rota system was set up for maria alex and i to use the shower the single bowl and single mug
the idea of simply sharing each one in turn was mooted but optimism is a good thing yknow being thoroughly exhausted and all resting on the single bed together the look on gregs face when he came to knock on the window was priceless
this never happens in my room he says mockseriously
i feel no compulsion to explain the decidedly less exciting truth of the matter i just smile and leave the illusion
please excuse my absence and also the fact that in the near future i may not be around so much
there was this thing you see and there was an issue and so we all moved and were not there any more
and im so tired of running around being responsible that i shant say much more
greg less uprooted than myself has written an account of the last couple of days
all i shall say is no internet connection is losing secretly stealing illegal minifridge for personal use is winning
in other news i now have my mouse up and running and it is lovely
i am also considering buying an inexpensive digital camera to supplement this here site with illustrations of exactly what the hell im talking about
on monday night as i lay awake before the onslaught of the day to come and during the onslaught of the rain which surely played its part i got to thinking of a story from my past that i should like to share
the reason i thought of it was my by now usual insomnia and all those fruitless efforts people make to try to sleep when their body albeit ready to drop is having none of it
secondary school before i gave up my childish dreams of doing something i wanted in life i took a gcse in drama
part of this course was taken by a large somewhat sweaty man called george cockroft who looked not a little like john mccririck
which thinking back is a bit weird
i liked him a lot he was an intelligent man who for all i know on the subject taught us well
but there is one lesson that still stays with me in the drama studio a big room that could be blacked out essentially one time he had the entire class of around twenty five lay flat on our backs completely relaxed whilst all the lights were turned out
and as we lasy there in the dark the giggling subsided eventually he began to talk to us taking us through a systematic relaxation of our bodies
it was amazing i think over half of us fell asleep and the rest of us had never been so still
i still use the same technique today and with discipline it works
at the end of the fifth year when we had taken our exams and all was done mr cockroft was leaving the school
and i remember one day it may have been sports day a beautifully sunny day being outside on the field and having a brief talk with him
i imagine i said something like how much id enjoyed the drama course and doing the plays and the such
i imagine he said something like he was glad id enjoyed it etc
and then i said something like so im not sure when ill see you again and i remember him looking at me in a mysterious almost mischievious way this man was about fiftyfive i reckon and saying oh i think itll be sooner than you think
i never saw him again
the humidity of recent days has lead to increased insomnia but has also lead to the first five minutes of returning home into a game of how fast the vast majority of my clothes can be removed
right now i am wearing only the shorts that earned me the name of chicken legs earlier this year
maybe it is something about this room that tends the occupant towards nudity but i have done well today visiting town for the briefest time i have bought a mouse for purely rational
as much as i like the trackpad it is time for seriousness
serioucism anyway the online delivery charge of 30 of the mouses worth causing the trip to town i was pleased to quickly find the one i wanted on the shelf
in a cylindricaltype packaging admittedly very fetching there was no information as to whether the software is on cd or diskette
i asked the man in the shop is the software on cd for this mouse
i held up the mouse i meant
let me tell you now he is a lying swine
so now i have no immediate way of loading my mouse driver
purely rational has no floppy drive it is a laptop of the future and besides i couldnt be bothered to pay for an extrenal drive
my old laptop does have a floppy drive but it doesnt have a cd burner
nor does it have a modem or network plug
it is a laptop of the past and besides it was free
in fact of their 26 assorted ports and things there is no way whatsoever that i can make the two machines talk to each other in the way i would like without buying some extra read expensive hardware
anyway ive arranged for it to be done now
but ergh it annoys me
i might write a snotty letter to dixons no link because they are evil evil lying swine although they offer cordless optical mice at affordable prices and hope they send me something cool

i resent paying over 50p for a loaf of bread sure it tastes nicer but seeing as i never get through a loaf fast enough to avoid throwing the last three or four slices away as i did this morning
i am now trying stays fresher longer bread 44p
i have high hopes except i have doubt about the grammar
shouldnt it be stays fresh longer or just stays fresher or am i too worried about my bread the last thing to mention today is the post office and some interesting distinctions in the british postal service
i am sending a friend a cd and i am enclosing a brief letter with it
if i send it as a small package it is cheaper than sending it letterrate
imagine you are sending someone a book if you send it on its own it is a small package and can be sent relatively cheaply
if however you enclose a letter with it then as far as the post office is concerned the entire weight of the parcel is your letter and you are charged accordingly
but what constitutes a letter for the small package rate you are allowed to enclose a brief letter which references only the item you are sending
so if you write dear jeff here is the copy of three men in a boat i promised hope you enjoy it then no problem
but write dear jeff here is the copy of three men in a boat i promised hope you enjoy it
little malcolm fell off his bike yesterday
then pow you have just according to the postal service written a comic novel
so if they ask you if theres a letter inside when youre at the counter you know what to say
and you too can make sure youre sending things as cheaply as possible even if it does mean you have to write as i do small package on everything you send

a slow day getting things done like cutting your toenails tend not to count as truly productive they are to the working day as shampoo is to the shopping list something that occasionally has to be done but more of an imposition than anything else
thesis word count 650 like i say a slow day
but i have been having some fairly interesting thinks
i truth if everything we know or learn is necessarily brought to us by our own perception then it doesnt matter whether there is any absolute truth because we will never know it
ii labels labels on relationships only serve to give rise to expectations of certain behaviour expectations drawn from the media demographic ensembles and hearsay that can never realistcally be matched by any random that is to say nonspecific individual
this mismatching of expectation with reality regardless of how perfect the reality leads to disappointment and eventually conflict
the need to categorise things is an outward desire and serves no purpose to the individuals involved who will tend to know whats going on
the driving force is to have a neat labelled pigeonholetype box for the relationship that others will understand with the minimum of explanation but if every relationship an analogue quantity if every there was one is forced into one of any number of discrete boxes digital classification then the fit will never ne perfect analoguetodigitl conversion and information is irrevocably lost
its just laziness thats all
pisses me off that people can break up over such an unnecessary thing
iii gravy boats and gravy trains
iv language when was the last time anyone described themselves to you as hot or cold instead of really hot or really cold or the like language is something that people invented and yet they dont use it properly if words have definitions and we can invent new words with appropriate definitions as needs be then why isnt language sufficient to expess what we want to say and if it is sufficient then why dont we use it properly this follows a conversation i had recently which went roughly as follows ros i guess that depends on what you mean by happy
guil the oxford english dictionary defines it as feeling or showing pleasure or contentment
ros yeah well i wouldnt define it that way
anyone else find that amusingfrustrating mind you to get technical i guess it depends how you define definition
enough thoughts i should get out more

a very serious thing has happened today i realised that charlotte s birthday has passed without my noticing
an indication of something a milestone perhaps neither but certainly noteworthy
the time has come to abandon my life in favour of what i must do

not an auspicious start it being four months or so too late but it has begun all the same
i shall keep you updated
unfortunately it will mean less time for finding bizarre but wonderful things like this but that is the price i must pay
for all the analysis is helping me understand my own mind and those of others it is worthy to note that the solution of problems still comes down to just getting on with it

it seems that i am a difficult person to get hold of or so i have been recently told by more than a couple of people
the main downside to gasp not having a mobile telephone was brought back to me today when it transpires that my best friend tried to call last night and i wasnt around
unfortunate rather than malicious but im still a little sad about it
especially since i was erely over in the common room chainwatching buffy the vampire slayer until three in the morning
and as to the advice i can give you its all guesswork im afraid
there is no greater mystery than the intricacies of women

and yes i measaured the bread
but i only did it roughly to establish its nonsquareyness since presumably there is a variation in each slice and trying to find the mean and standard deviation would just be silly
and what was the greatest thing before sliced bread and when they made the first sliced loaf did it have an even number of slices so making sandwiches was more convenient what would they do with the last slice and were the sparrows fatter all important questions im sure youll agree
also catching my eye just yesterday was the notices around the lake i use the word loosely in our nearby park reading danger deep water and danger thin ice
now surely thin ice is only a danger because of the deep water beneath it well i suppose you could slip over but im not sure thats what the sign is getting at
surely the sign should read danger deep water danger thin ice danger gravity i think this could also be applied to other situations danger cliff face danger gravity danger sharp bend danger newtons first law of motion you get the idea
i will undoubtedly have something else to say at some point but for now i think tea and toast is the way forward

night is the worst its when i wander more when sounds seem louder and when i still find time to talk to her memory
she is gone appropriately through time 4 years 5 and space some hundred miles sometimes thousands and yet the closest i get to someone understanding me at these times is to imagine her still here
aside i suppose sounds seem louder at night due to a simple comparison with other noise present ie there is less background at night
the same way the moon seems larger when it is close to the horizon for direct comparison with everyday objects i think too much
see night is the worst
what an entertaining morning after the insights of therapy and the delight of having already had a shower joy i headed off to the shortest film festival in the world
this is run by the people at nokia who want you to buy their phones and are selling them on the basis of their moviemaking features
there are nine films and all are less than fifteen seconds long
intriguing yes you can watch them on that link if you like but i nipped down to a local cinema to watch them on the big ish screen a cinema with a small bench seat the whole thing measuring 2 cubic metres
my favourite is i think the divorce by a matt bloom
more important though and something im taking as some sort of sign was one of the girls manning the booth was absolutely stunning a becky jagoalike if ever i saw one
im tempted to go back
this sets me thinking about beauty again clearly an important subject in my head
how can the simple existance of someone as pretty as should have asked her name dammit cheer me up for the day we shared nothing except the most trivial of conversation
what is at work here most curious
what is worst of all is that on account of her face okay teeth mainly
i am actually going to go to the website to enter the competition to win the damn phone i am being manipulated by someone and what annoys me is that its probably me
on the way home i stopped off at the charity shops and managed to pick up the new york trilogy by paul auster i can hear a certain grey kitty meowing at that one for a mere one english pound and fortynine pennies
i liked the invention of solitude so i have high hopes although not for happy endings
in the same shop i also bought something eponymous by the for carnation whom i have never heard of
a six track cd with each track lasting over five and a half minutes it will surely be value for money
what tipped the scales however was the tiny sleeve note announcing vocals on one of the tracks by a certain rachel haden of that dog fame
fame oh alright then but shes done backing vocals with weezer and jimmy eat world and thats good enough for me

and no im not talking about the incessant rain
i actually like the rain the sevenmonth manchester winter of grey and mizzle is part of the appeal
i guess i just like wearing coats and to quote the otters the rain soothes the tempest that is my soul
at my therapists this morning we identify patterns that lead to my quote deviousness unquote and we learn exactly why it is that my mother quote pisses me off unquote
i am sure that this is progress
on the way out i pick up a leaflet for calm an organisation i fully support through my general apathy
the leaflet says suicide is the biggest killer amongst men aged from 1535 years old
it accounts for 21 of all deaths among this age group in britain
this phenomenon which started in the 1970s is echoed across europe the us and australia
this is i think youll agree quite startling
is does raise the question as to why men started killing themselves in the seventies i blame fashion
also the telephone lines are open from 5pm to 3am every day
these hours lead to two obvious conclusions i the miserable also need to sleep ii men only become miserable after watching newsround which is understandable since the departure of the delectable becky jago
at eleven in the morning i am delighted to say i have already had four of the recommended five portions of fruit
they are 1 bowl muesli i avoided being pulled in by the strong currants 2 satsumas 1 apple i have been musing on happiness i will return

whatever else happens and whatever i am yet to be guilty of i cant say that i planned it
look from time to time im a sensible kind of guy
i know ill probably never be to you what i would like to be
i know it was just a result of your circumstances that made things the way they were and now theyve changed and everything has to settle down again
i guess i just wanted to put it down somewhere that im glad that i was lucky enough to be in the wrong place at the right time
im glad that i was able to glimpse something so much more than me
the wellmeaning drunk oh sure their hearts in the right place and im glad he stopped by to apologise for all the noise and such but at half four in the morning there are better things i can think of doing

like that ever stopped me
quote of the day is good even out of context there are things you dont do
ive been neglecting the blog of late not through intention but through a combination of distraction and not really being sure of what to say
the days have been a mass of getting nothing done and sleeping in varying amounts of fitfulness
maybe this has lead to a time where i have nothing to say the blogger page has lain open on my computer for many many hours waiting but unsatisfied
a meagre list again of girls
they are after all what make any story worth telling
and so girls that have been away and are returning to my life alex 4 months ro 1 month helen 12 months rachael 12 months and they expect me to get any work done n
so many things i could talk about today
didnt get to talk to my daddy left him a message though
spent the day with minime asking where her dad was and why he was taking so long to see her
but made her smile and feel special no matter what
talked to a few people today old friends new friends special people
i am sooooooo proud of my friend sean for his marathon run today yay i better get my butt in gear and get back in shape or i will never keep up hahaha
so i was thinking yeah yeah today i actually did think the whole concept of good karma and reaping what you sow
if energy can never be destroyed
maybe the actual energy generated while you are doing something for others is released somehow into the ether and one day will cause a positive reaction in someone else that eventually gets back to you
likewise the bad energy too
never know huh was an interesting thought though
i think i will eat something really bad for me now so i can have freaky dreams and write another interesting blog in the morning
when i was hanging out with dino
we were talking about the higher quality of greek leather
well he was i was pretending i thought he was right
he was going on about how they make good belts
i think he had been awake for something like 49 hours at this point meeting a work deadline i was thinking yannow
i have heard about a lot of things from greece dont think belts were in that list sometimes i think
holy molaaaaay i need more coffee or a brain or a greek belt cheers
what sort of weirdo are you this quiz by orsa
ugh finally the only show worth watching on tv has come along
the wbs superstar usa ooooh man i love that show
an underhanded and mean reality show that takes awful singers who think they are good and lets them howl on international tv
the cast members they chose were perfect toneloc vitamin c and a guy named briggs
their acting ability to sit there and pretend to be loving people singing like cats in a blender in indeed impressive
so they take them to hollywood give them makeovers and let them sing
the final 4 were well chosen jojo who told people it was his gahdunkadunk that made him star material
that means his butt for those not in the know wink mario who must weigh all of 90 pounds soaking wet and looks like the kids who used to get shoved in lockers in high school
jaime the obligatory blonde bimbo with more cup size than cranium size
rosa the latina firecracker who lives in her own lil world and was probably the worst singer there
i do have to admire all the entertainers confidence in themselves albeit a lil misguided
i missed the last show because someone special was getting her swimming badge and have tried to find more info on how the show went down
a few comments here and there online only to find that jaime won ughhhh nooooooo for gawd sakes do we not have enough female poptarts out there these days yes her looks will sell her to the male audiences even if she cant sing
i think we needed someone like mario to give all those male singers a run for their pec and chin implants
yeah the worst singer but she didnt have the spark and she cant shake it like jlo and aguilera
jojo was just too sweet i think or too simple
i dunno one or the other
apparently it works for a woman but not for a man
yay jaime you have just become a part of the machine that is stardombut for the love of all that is sacred someone give her cue cards so she can stop writing lyrics on her hands cheers
we always hear statistics stating we are an aging nation but how does that really affect us all the advances in health care and medicine have people who might not have otherwise survived living till their 80s and 90s
a couple thousand years ago 30 really was middle age and 60 was as old as 90 is today
always searching for the youth the secret of eternal life
dealing with a whole other area of medicine that will become the focus of all our healthcare dollars even more so
geriatrics i love my lil grandma dearly but it is so hard to watch her age she was born in 1918 the year influenza b swept across north america and killed so many
indeed her own mother became very ill when my grandma was only a few months old
grandma was sent to stay with aunt lizzie till her ma was better
she managed to stay well through that
she also managed to survive as one of the middle children in a family of 9 kids
in a house with no running water
i think about how my child will never know what its like to have to live with an outhouse and baths in the kitchenwell those ones in the sink when she was 6 months old were cute hehe
my grandma married a man 12 years her senior whom was the love of her life
brought 4 kids into this world on dairy farms
watched my grandfather grow more and more ill after he retired and take care of him like a nurse after his many strokes
he passed away in 1988 and she has never even considered another man
then her energy was directed back to her kids and grandkids and most importantly her garden
that woman has more strength and courage than most of the people i know
and as i watch her health start to fail at the age of almost 86
i find myself dealing with the one of the hard truths of life
we all will die one day
so i am not sure if i am more upset at the fact she will not be here forever
or the fact that i wont
there are days it seems i have to much to say and no one to say it to
sometimes my ideas seem profound sometimes just plain funny
maybe getting it all out there and have someone stumble across them and maybe laugh maybe cry maybe learn something
might be a good idea
or i can just pretend people actually are interested in my errant rantings now and then
so i raise a glass of
water and say cheers webi
thats what i would truly like to beeeeeee
cause if i were an oscar mayer wienerrrrrrrr
everybodyd be in love with me
i treated myself today to some dresses i felt so gross the last week
i realized i had only one really pretty dress
i am a girl i guess i can act like one once in a while instead of feeling like i have to be some plain non descript blending into the crowd figure
id like to be able to look in the mirror and say daaaamn i look good and really think it
for all my bravado about not caring what other people think about my looks
i need to be less critical about what i think of them
i know the really good stuff is on the inside i know how to love i know how to care i know how to make others feel appreciated
but i live in a culture that has ingrained into my being this myth about beauty
i did some reading a few nights about about body image and older civilizations
dammit if i lived in the time of reuben
we are taught young to find fault with ourselves
our lack of looking like that less than 1 of women who actually do model
i still find it so bizarre they use women we can never be instead of the women we are to sell us things
there would be something self satisfying to see more women just like us model
or models chosen on the basis of their deeds
cause in the end its how good you were not how good you looked
nbsp i had more to say but i got distracted so yeah then i guess i am done for now
thats all i want to say to youuuuu
nbsp ok maybe not just that
i got a lot done today fever seems to be almost gone
had most of the day to myself which was kind of nice
did some yard worka lot ofnbspcleaning some resting
then got a phone call that my precious was not comfy where she was having a sleep over and wanted to come home
thats ok though we can try another time
nbsp im a little nervous about going back to work but i still have a bit more time
i will go back to needing to catch up on so much and take account for the time and targets i missed
i think its going to be ok i feel like i have a better sense of purpose now
maybe i just need to get primal and kill that fear
funny how a slight change in the way you perceive something can shift you to a whole other view
nbsp although i dont think being painted up in tribal colors and jumping on the desks will go over well at work
ooooh wait thats right metaphorical
lol nbsp ok i am done
nothing else to say today
i am a candle burning bright to light your way on darkest nights your path you choose you take your steps i hold your hand along the way and raise you up from broken wings you find your voice you sing your song i hear your soul and sing along nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp um yeah it was there waiting
now it is in words
so much and so much and so much
i am happy that i have started to take the time to learn more about why and how i react to things
accept a challenge now and then learn from how i react to them too
and through all of it
remember i can do anything i set my mind to
i have felt like there were times in my life when i dragged myself with my finger nails to get through
whatta ya know i made it
and i will keep moving forward
i can feel the energy in the core of my being maybe i should try to bask in it more often
i have so many thoughts on so many different topics today
i can say this bring it cheers
i was thinkin back to a poem i wrote a while ago thought i had saved a copy
and now cant find it
i am going to try to get it back out of the deep recesses of my brain though
too bad it never found its way to anyone who appreciated it though lol
if time was a river if time was a river that flowed to the sea and love was the vessel that would carry me id pack it with patience with laughter with care with passion and friendship and take some to spare if time was a river that flowed to the sea and love was the vessel that would carry me id need someone steadfast to be on my crew and if i had get to choose i plan to choose you ok thats not exactly the original but not bad if i do say so myself
i should dig up my old poems and get them on the blog
might be good for trip down my dark and twisted memory lane
i was actually missing work today but know i am not ready to go back just yet
a couple more weeks and i should feel better able to face the world head on again
its been nice to just kind of see where the day takes me but then i think about all those people i am not getting to help
i sometimes shake my head at the apathy so many of my coworkers have
then again so many people in the world are apathetic
when i get to hear wow thank you soooo much why has no one ever taken that time to explain this to me or you are a dear you took all my worries away at least i know for the few minutes that person talked to me they felt like someone somewhere cared about who they were and what they needed
someone told me i had too much to give one time isnt that what its about though you give of yourself to the right people
and they give back to you
not rocket science yannow or give the right things to the right people
i almost wonder if it takes a stronger person to accept that you deserve to be given back to
instead of feeling like you constantly are going to owe something to someone
sometimes when you look for something so hard you dont see that what you need might be right in front of you
we all live with perceptions
about ourselves others the world
spend a lot of time classifying the same
in the pursuit of all things wonderful we forget the wonder in what we already have
nothing is sweeter than realizing that old adage
its not having what you want
its wanting what you have
im taking time for me for a change and it is not an easy thing
i am so used to being many things to many people
but what i keep getting told is that if i dont take care of me first my efforts are pretty much wasted
funny after 33 years to be told my expectations of myself are too high
when i have thought i just wasnt trying hard enough
if only what i dont know
i love finding the beauty and art in everything
the way the sun shines through the leaves on my apple tree just so
the brilliant diamond sparkles as it dances across the water in the pool
the flowing motion of the ripples across the pool as a giggling child spins around as fast as she can in the water
i still think its one of the best things i have ever and will ever hear
right up there with hearing her sweet voice first thing in the morning reminding me i am loved
its been far too long since the depth of my love for her has moved me to tears
and here i sit reminding myself that she is the reason i need to be whole and happy
take that extra minute to find the beauty in your day that one small reason no matter what it might be
remind yourself it doesnt all have to be stress and hurry
cause this ride around the sun will be as brief as the ones before and the cosmos needs your spark of light to be full of everything that made you smile
what the hell is that dammit i just had a flu i dont want another i have to go back to work on monday iiiicccckkkkkyyy i went there today to see what was up and found out they moved my desk or at least they will on monday
so i will get to unpack all my stuff and set my junk up again lol
i should take more pins and tacks cause i am sure all mine got stolen
the more things change the more things stay the same only not only do only not
and know what else weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee httpwww
php dont click that link if you are offended by the word gonads

i pay for more than my fair share me 43952 pm so quit working so hard
you wouldnt pay so much in taxes me 43959 pm you pay for the lifestyle you want to lead him 44023 pm if everyone had that attitude we would have no roads
and no freedom to choose me 44041 pm so you want that stuff as long as you dont have to pay for it him 44104 pm i do pay for it
but i also pay for other people who dont pay for it me 44120 pm i work hard
i pay what the government says i have to pay
i cant helop their laws him 44125 pm you are the one who wants it
but does not pay for it me 44139 pm if everyone had jobs like yours your trash wouldnt get picked up every week
your stores wouldnt have anything in them because there would be no truck drivers to haul it there would be no waitress to take your order then next time you eat in a restaurant him have news for you
trash haulers make 40k a year and belong to unions me 44245 pm my ex husband is a trash hauler for the city
he makes 10 an hour with no union him44309 pm that is because he choose to live in a little town and haul trash me 44327 pm you can live the life you choose but no one else can me 44328 pm interesting me 44356 pm and if there were no farmers which my whole family is what would be on your dinner table tonight him 44426 pm i believe it is my duty as an american to pay my fair share

and everything they want me 45309 pm the starting point is to stop raising taxes and start cutting out things that are not neccesary me 45325 pm raising taxes is treating the symptom and not the disease him 45330 pm why someone who has a million dollars in the bank when they die gets 55 of it taken by the govt
this is money they already paid taxes on me 45432 pm so why bother making that money and putting it in the bank if the government is going to take it anyway this is not a personal attack this is just a hypothetical question for the sake of the debate him 45442 pm if we are all supposed to be equal
why is my tax rate twice of yours me 45456 pm i dont know

i am actually punished for being more productive me 45510 pm not the little people me 45518 pm yes you are me 45538 pm you are not making a good point here for me wanting to be more productive and it went on
id like to hear other opinions on this
he wasnt my birth dad but he adopted me when he married my mom i was 1 12
they divorced when i was about 14 or so but he was always a part of my life
i hadnt seen him in a year
every time i went there he found a way to insult me i always left there feeling bad
my step mom had called today said he was real bad
my sister and i were going up tomorrow to see him
i wanted to put things right between us
i wanted to tell him that i still loved him
my friends say that of course he knew that
but i dont know that
i didnt get to look into his eyes and tell him that
please if anyone ever reads this no matter what time of day or night it is if your parents are still living call them now and tell them you love them
have you ever read the picture of dorian gray by oscar wilde it is an interesting book
here is an interesting bit i just came across reading today
im rereading the book havent read it in years only when one is young she answered
when an old woman like myself blushes it is a very bad sign
ah lord henry i wish you would tell me how to become young again
he thought for a moment
can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days duchess he asked looking at her across the table
a great many i fear she cried
then commit them over again he said gravely
to get back ones youth one has merely to repeat ones follies
a delightful theory she exclaimed
i must put it into practice
a dangerous theory came from sir thomass tight lips
lady agatha shook her head but could not help being amused
yes he continued that is one of the great secrets of life
nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are ones mistakes
a laugh ran round the table
the only thing one regrets is ones mistakes
im not sure that i agree with that
to get back ones youth one had merely to repeat ones follies
so many people tell me that i look and act so much younger than i am but the acting young is what promotes the looking young
other people my age think that now that they are a certain age they have to act a certain way
that is what makes people old
old is an attitude not an age
i can think of lots of follies from my youth i would love to repeat
and do so on every available occasion
i suppose i am the last person to hear this group but i just did so recently
my tastes in music vary widely
classic rock alternative rock techno country jazz rb hiphop new age classical
just about anything but polka
appologies to the polka fans out there
this is my current obsession
living out in the boonies in southwestern kansas has its advantages but available radio stataions and nearby music stores are not among them
so i listen to lacuna coil online until i can get somewhere that actually sells their music
check out their website at httpwww
consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative
scars heal glory fades and all were left with are the memories made pain hurts but only for a minute life is short so go on and live it
life isnt a journey to the grave with the intentions of arriving safely in a pretty well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out loudly proclaiming damn what a ride
one of the best gothic poetry sites on the web in my opinion is this one httpwww
html ravens poetry is brilliant breaking the gothic poetry stereotype
everyone thinks gothic poetry poems about death
crystal night i walked out one crystal night and the air was cold and black every star held bright and true against its midnight back the moon hung low above the trees as silent as a ghost and i sat there in the fields as frigid as a post this night was so gorgeous just like a movie scene and even the trees kept still to keep my view pristine my mind began to wonder through thoughts about this place it wished to share with someone natures purest face but around me there was not a soul not a heart to make a sound and i knew i was all alone when i began to look around then my heart felt empty like the space between the stars i knew the night alone couldnt heal all my scars so with that i began to walking back into the night i knew that i would need someone to help me win this fight so now i must leave this scene until some other time because until i can share it its just a song without a rhyme raven if poetry interests you at all you must check this site out
even if you are not goth open your mind and experience something new
first you should read my profile
having done that we can proceed
this is mainly a place to collect all my favorite quotes poetry some of mine included and websites i like
i am a large mix of many personalities and talents
this could be an interesting trip
maybe that last entry was typed with rose colored glasses on
he is a very great guy but i never get to see him that much
havent seen him in two weeks or talked to him in over 1 week
i really think we could be perfect except i need somone i can do things with
my sister the golden child has a great man
she always has great guys
and always gets her way and has a perfect house
not to mention she is 61 about 130 wringing wet is very pretty and very classically feminine
she has it all always has
she and her boyfriend are constantly together doing things with his kids and working on his farm together
he is very respected he is the undersheriff of our county
i seem to have a sign on my forehead that says losers welcome because that is the only group of men who ever ask me out
sigh not that steven is a loser by all means but he is so busy in his life and set in his ways he doesnt think about taking me with him to go do things and i live 45 miles away and most of the time he would have to pick me up because my exhusband has my car
life just kinda sucks but seems id better get used to it eh
it never ceases to amaze me how wonderful it is to go to stevens farm
out in the middle of nowhere with a half mile long driveway
not to mention that steve is the most wonderful man on the planet
i am so glad we decided to stick it out and stay together looks like we are going to be together for a long while
he told me i have finally decided to admit it
after three years i admit that i love you and i want more of you in my life
then he asked me what i thought about that
i said its about damn time
the good girl wins out in the end
lol life couldnt get much better than this
i have the night off
and im spending the day and probably the night at stevens
i hope that my patience has paid off
he has come to a point in his life where he wants to settle down with one woman he can trust
and he says the only one he can trust is me
that he has always known that i was the one
said i scared him a bit because i understood him way more than any other woman ever has
he isnt the sort to get close to anyone really
but we are close and that has bothered him in the past but he has accepted it now
he knows i love him no matter what
we will see how it goes
i have thought this was happening in the past only to go months without hearing from him
but maybe this is the time
im holding back judgment though i have been hurt too much before
there are a couple of guys who have been sort of trying to get me to see them but they are both attached
both of them not traditionally married but have livein girlfriends
and i just wont go there
i talked to both of them last night and they both made slightly jealous little comments
i am just not that sort of girl
plus steven has always been the high standard in my heart
no one lives up to him
old school punk you just say what you have to say regardless of what everyone else thinks youre one of my most favourite types of music
youre raw and uncut youre surrounded by hype
just dont let it make you go insane
what genre of rock are you brought to you by quizilla
i have had an onagain offagain relationship with steven for the last three years
he goes months without calling me but every time he calls i go back to him
its hard to explain but he is exactly what i want
and if living this way is the cost of being able to be with him occasionally i suppose its worth it
he is extremely intelligent 64 240piercing blue eyes very intense disciplined confident
but he is also very kind and caring
he makes me feel completely safe when i am with him
and even in the months inbetween i know that if anything happens to me i can call on him and he will be there
if anyone ever hurt me i know he would take care of it
he is a little scary maybe knowing what i know about the world he lives in and some of the people he knows
but he is so strong i have always felt like he was my protector
anyway he has contacted me again
it is so wonderful seeing his messages knowing he is still thinking about me even if his life gets too complicated to call or email me at times
maybe i will go to be with him soon that would be wonderful
someday i hope to be with him all the time
but until then i will take what i can get
arwen if i were a character in the lord of the rings i would be arwen elf the daughter of elrond
in the movie i am played by liv tyler
who would you be zovakware lord of the rings test with perseus web survey software i would have rather been eowyn
i think i have more in common with her
we both would rather ride into battle with the men than stay behind
we both end up falling in love with a man already taken
she and i have lots more in common i think than arwen and i
although having a man like aragorn in love with me is worth this test saying i am arwen
lol i do have a man i am in love with
he is sort of like aragorn although he has a dark side that aragorn doesnt have
maybe hes more like boromir
who by the way is the one in that movie that really drove me crazy
last night my night off i ended up working from midnight to 430 am because my best friend at work pulled a noshow nocall
he showed up at 4 seems he and his girlfriend were fighting all day and he took off too mad to think about coming to work
hed better grow out of that maybe take some anger management classes and maybe get rid of the girlfriend if shes gonna be that much trouble
just because two people have a child together doesnt mean they were meant to be together forever
anyway i didnt have any sleep before i went in and i was dead by the time i got home
got woke up by severe thunderstorms this morning
hail as big as shooter marbles
now its just wet and gloomy
will be going to sleep later have to go in to work at midnight my own shift this time this gloomy day will make for good sleeping
found some interesting movie trailers last night
look like pretty good movies
one of them is from m
night shyamalan who has done some really great movies like the others signs and sixth sense
cant wait to see that one
comifilmdetail2483648 the other is ju on the grudge a japanese horror film
comifilmdetail2639981 can you tell i like horror movies lol
com is a great website
another one i really like is httpwww
com i cant wait for my daughter to get here to watch her brother
its extremely dark in my bedroom and its nice and coolmaybe i lived in a cave in a former life and the thunder is still rumbling and the rain falling lightly
what a great afternoon to sleep
this place is wearing on me like it did growing up here
everyone in this town works their ass off trying to be just like every one else
someone needs to tell them that the world does not end at the county line
we are citizens of the world not just of hick county
around here music means classic rock or country
i listen to those too
i listen to gothic punknbspalternative jazz rampb soul classical techno industrial you name it
lol i have friends around the world online and from all religions and races
if most of the people here knew i had friends that were pagan or wiccan or heaven forbid agnostic i would probably be burned at the stake
i get so tired of knowitall people who never think outside the box
i love art and poetry and good literature
i crave intelligent conversation on literature philosophy religion
i want to be able to buy really good clothes without driving 250 miles
i hate walmart i long for coffee shops with real cappuchino not the powdered kind that sputters out of a machine like bad hot cocoa
a book store with a good selection a music store that actually has the music i want cooper temple clause is an unheard of group in this godforsaken place i want to get my nose pierced without losing my job
yes i was told i cant work where i work with my nose pierced my house is probably the only one for miles that is decorated in modern furniture and artwork
95 of all homes here are done in cutsey country
all women are expected to be sweet little things quiet respectful
that isnt me either i am tough intelligent and that scares most rednecks
what am i still doing here i wanted my son to go to a small school
not one with rampant drugs and teen pregnancies and security guards
i suppose this is a small price to pay for my son but i will be 49 years old when he is 18
will i be too old to start my real life then
why cant i just learn to say no last night at work a guy came in i hadnt seen in a while
well for lack of a better term were fuck buddies when i was in high school
he was with another woman but while she was busy at the counter he came back and talked to me
flirting hinting at things that we had done back then and asked for my phone number and email
and i gave it to him i know for a fact that he is not interested in what i am looking for
i want a real relationship i want someone that respects me cares about me
he just wants someone to play with
i know that so why did i not just say no when i married my husband i loved him
but i also had in the back of my mind the thought that no one else would ever ask me to marry him so id better say yes
that recording seems to be still playing in my head as if i should feel grateful to any man who shows the least bit of attention to me
i know that is what i am doing yet when the man is standing there i dont think about it
i simply grab onto the attention like a woman overboard grabbing a flotation device
nbsp i get so mad at myself sometimes
i seem to be scared to say no
nbsp i have been doing the same thing with another man stuart
all he is looking for is a good time
but i tell him oh yeah ill call
instead of just telling him that we want different things and a roll in the hay is not what i want
someday somehow this has got to change
but im not sure how to get there
i have a habit of constantly heading down deadend roads that i know are dead ends
not real roads but lifes roads
i usually only am attracted to older men
i have never really been attracted to younger men
i have a friend that is 10 years younger than me that i am very attracted to
not a bad thing in and of itself but he has a girlfriend
why do i always fall for the ones i cant have girlfriends wives
every man i find myself being attracted to is already attached
isnt there some psychological reasoning behind that maybe its just that what they say is true
all the good ones are taken
i dont know but it drives me crazy
and he drives me crazy
and it doesnt help that he is an incessant flirt that just makes me feel worse
note to guys if you are otherwise attached please dont be a tease if you are not happy in your relationship get out of it then you can flirt
even though i am exhausted after today i must get in my rant to get a good nights sleep
my sister freakin disgusts me
those whove kept up to date with my family drama knows what shes like but its like she gets more disrespectful towards my parents me whomever every day
and the fact that my folks continually put up with her sh astounds me
kick her out of the god damn house im sorry she no longer has gas money to get tofrom work until her next payday because shes giving it to her deadbeat no job iscammyownkidbecauseimtoolazytowork boyfriend
make her walk to work dad take the bus whatever
make her grow up stop bailing her out literally figuratively you name it
stop cosigning her bankruptcy papers stop interrupting your day to bring her lunch stop letting her order beer with dinner after two duis stop allowing her jackass boyfriend over without backing your threats to call the cops on him
stop enabling her im beyond angry at her now theres no point anymore
she is and will probably always be a mememe person and the way she treats my parents she can frankly go to hell at this point
but the fact that my parents keep taking it over and over saying that theyre finally going to draw the line and enforce rules but then get lazy about following up with it im about ready to distance myself from all of them
if your own lives household health or sanity isnt worth fighting for nothing i can try to say anymore is going to change your minds
you pretend to listen but apparently im the only one who feels your existence is worth it
kick her out for the love of god and let her finally live with the consequences of her dumbass decisions
shes freakin 24 shell learn to deal
my god are there any nondysfunctional families out there anymore seriously okay im done now
really cant wait for the holidays now
today travis and i went out to run a few errands and have a nibble afterwards
in an attempt to do so however we discovered the true meaning of hell on earth as we know it
this hell is otherwise known as u village
you may be familiar with it what with its trendy overpriced department stores and coffee shops orangefleshed patrons pushing the pedals of their graduationgift lexuses with their pristine ugg boots
we honestly could not understand what about this place made seemingly normal people such twits
parents suddenly flinging their toddlers into the street because they after all do have the right of way
stay at home moms in trendy touregs blocking entire lanes in the parking lot so that they could selfishly have that next available spot no matter how long the line behind her was
hell it all connects to a bigger picture to me the things that rank high on my pet peeve list
its why i hate leaving home on weekends
the chaos the carelessness the selfish people who think its all about them in this world
its making me already dread the approaching holiday season for the love of god i hope people dont mind more internet shopping this year i fear that with my lowering tolerance and increasing road rage that my braking foot might fail at a very inopportune time for you dear affluent family with your tripleseated stroller walking down the very center of the road without any regard of my approaching bumper right on your tevas
come now would it really be such a shame to have one less of you out there i thought not
because i fear the wraith and hoggle equally as much it will probably be a while before a young fellow called kristensen will hear about my joining the blogging world
for those who do learn of my existence here expect nothing earthshattering or mindblowing
you should know by now that i am a quiet one not as politically savvy as the menfolk in my life opinionated still but just choose to keep it to myself more often than not
so here goes some inner thoughts
i just read some of foutsys previous postings and i have to say it hes an outright liar
when referring to the 4ths fireworks display he states that hes just not as impressed with big flashy things
and yet not a single other person could outjump him or squeal louder than his shrill soprano voice could at tims bachelor party
all of the other men had fallen silent at the sight of the groomtobes scrotal bling but not the fouts
it was blinding and it was magnificent
most of you do too admit it
theyre one of the only true bonuses of gaining a few extra pounds and i love it
theyre squishy they bounce just so they help fill out an outfit just a bit more they draw sometimes flattering other times creepy stares theyre fun
picture two octopi rubberbanded together and poke
last night the kids and i went to a local eating establishment and met tims new coworker gina
sweet girl funny outgoing cute for a borderline midget
i however hope that we can use young gina to get to her acquaintance with a most unfortunate name
run and hide tora teenus for you shall have no peace once you are found
painkiller the past is like a gaping hole no matter how hard you try to run from it you just find that you are running in circles you think of the cause and effect every action you have made the scar which the past had inflicted cannot be healed like a wounded bird trapped in a cage you realize that the same mistakes being made your conscience hunted you you start to doubt yourself asking yourself the same questions over and over again you felt weak no longer the will to walk on prayers to god was a momentarily salvation but never was it a cure painkillers ease but not your pain as you see your love ones one by one vanishing into the darkness when you tried to grasp and treasure them they were all gone your eyes were hollow empty without life when you tried to love another mistakes were repeated sorrows and misery embedded deepened and worsened
it is the birth of one and the evolution of another slave to its master yet a master to change bending rules forgoing the ancient laws words carved beautiful statues bringing them to life beating heart beats and explosion of emotions sorrows love pain and joy all intertwined birth of life and the dawn of death all raised from its graves only one who weaves its thread wield its might like a tamed lion becoming a friend to its lord
a cup filled with the rainbow of colours each signify a different meaning some surfaced to simplicity others hid deep meanings colours varied in different forms when blue might appear blue often it does not i was a boy a simple boy my appearance my shell my face my mask my heart is so disguise i fear so much to reveal my true self will others shy from me will the people who care for me leave will i be alone so many questionsso many answers i need to know fatigue washed over me like a tidal wave maintaining the cloak sapped my strength the weight of the world weigh down upon me nothing seems to aid still i have to carry on battling against an unseen enemy
time past like a dragging cart i studied the sea of sweaty faces some delighted in mirth others solemn and distant while i struggled with my apparent task the weight of the rifle seems to drag me down blood flowed from cuts pain and fatigue weakened my determined mind i lick the dry skin of my lips my feet turn from flesh to lead my mind and eyes wandered as sun faded out of view the day ended the weight of responsibilities and rules lifted from my shoulders a young primary student walk past me reminding me how fortunate they were but still they have to face the inevitable weight of responsibilities and the winding paths of failures
we must not fail our duty let us ride on lysandros barked a command as he spurred his steed onwards
he muttered a silent blessing to khaine as the fog begun to shroud the land
he and the few other scouts have lost their way among the fog if he does not bring this message to aldamir the rest of the army would be in peril
adamantios pointed ahead as a tide of darkness swarmed over the path ahead
lysandros nodded as they rode into the trees which provide ample cover for them
there was an order to keep silent and any communication was to be passed by hand signals
the chitterling horde marched forward ranks and ranks of units were tightly packed together
i hate this damn whether quikchitter bared his teeth
beside him nearly squirted the musk of fear as he tried to push it back
he was honored to be invited by the grey seer to ride upon the cauldron of thousand poxes
as the cauldron went it releases terrifying screams and laughter which would even send chill down the spin of a dragon
quikchitter pondered about where will be their next destination the arrogant quikwarp was almost too proud he should have let him walked with the rest of the army
quikwarp i have an important task for you
what is your wish most potent of potentates he replied boldly as he swings his tail around excitedly
i need you to go down and check to see if the ratling guns are working well recently there seems to be some minor malfunction quikchitter spoke rapidly spurting saliva into the cauldron of thousand poxes
only to be responded by hideous hissing sound
his ears lowered and lost his enthusiasm as he heard the bad news
he muttered silent cures to the grey seer and half hopingly that he hadnt heard it
he made his way down the filthy corpses as he pinched his nose he wondered how could the grey seer have stand to all these perhaps he have a spell which could remove this repugnant smell
it was all too possible the selfish grey seer would not impart his arcane arts to anyone
as he walked towards his own company of clan skyre rats he thought he had smelled something
among the smell of furs and rats he smelled something unusual as he tried sniffing harder
elves he curse the day that he had been born the foul rats have spotted them
if they were to ride out from here they would be swarmed by hundreds of rats
there would be no chances of survival
if they were to abandon their horses here they would not make it in time to deliver the message
but sacrifices were needed to be made
he signaled one of men and whispered into his ears
his face betrayed incomprehension but swiftly nodded and proceeds to task
the grey seer stood upon the surveying his army as pride swelled within him
he attempts a grasp at the winds of magic
gathering a small globe of energy in his hands he blasted a slave pulling the cauldron
the rat expanded and contracted his eyes were red and was swelling to a point of bursting
poxes and symptoms of diseases appeared on his skin
and soon the rat exploded leaving only a pile of bones producing putrid smells
faster faster quick quick the grey seer snarled as he lashed out with his whip
suddenly bells were rung and he knew they were being attack
anger and rage boil within him as he wondered who dared an intrusion into his army
the frenzied monks broke of the ranks and gave chased towards their enemy
shouting war cries and froth and phlegms dripped from their mouth
quikchitter quickly cast a spell of vision and so he could see clearly what was disturbing their flanks
the vision shifted in and out blurring images and palpable ones
the spell stabled as he could see a horse running away from his army
stupid fools its only a horse he spoke softly under his breath
a green light glowed madly on his fingers sending the shadows dancing like a mad caper on the ground
he incanted the ancient words of his ancestors and unleashed a streak of green lighting towards the escaping horse
reducing it into a pile of dust
the blood frenzied monks gave up as they saw there was nothing to kill and hurried back to bolster the ranks of the army
a boyish smile appeared on his face as he savors the victory
lysandros spoke softly but just enough for the elves to hear
the young elf ducked as a blade shimmered past at the same time lashing out and hamstringing his brutish foe
the orc gave a deafening roar and fell to the ground like a huge tree shaking the ground
the thin elf stepped aside nimbly avoiding the collapsing bulk
drawing his dagger he bent down and delivered the killing blow
the champion looked up from the dead body and saw that his comrades werent doing so well
many of them had fallen before the orcish onslaught
he knew any moment from now would mean life and death
he raced with elegant steps across the slaughter ground avoiding the corpses on the ground
to me mansuetus commanded as he raises his sword high so everyone could see
within minutes the elves formed a circle around him raising their spears high threatening anyone who comes within a metre length
he surveyed his disciplined soldiers proudly
the welltrained elves did not fail him
a few orcs made a daring attempt trying to carve its way through but only ended but with spears through his torso
hold elves and you would live
expect no quarters for you would give them none the leader bellowed and every elf shouted in a single tone
hundred of orcs surrounded them waiting for a hole the defenses
a few orcs again made daring attempts but soon ended up dead
it seems the orcs werent as patient mansuetus thought as a smirk appeared on his face
on my command you would send this brutes to wherever they came from he shouted a command in the ancient language to the crossbowmen
the crossbowmen loaded their crossbow and nodded in understanding
finally the orcs patient was at an end the green skins roared and shouted war cries in their primitive language
now the champion signaled and spears was leveled to the eye and sound of crossbows unleashing death
this was what he savored every moment as the orcs lumbered into the wall of spikes
steel met steel blood splattered everywhere and sound of screams and shouts filled the air
fight on my elves and fight well for this day you will replenish the blood within your armors mansuetus charged in fray of combat slashing and hacking as he went
an orc twice the shoulder length of him and was the largest orc he had ever seen
the massive orc bawled a challenge and was quickly answered
through the visor he stare into the eye of his foe trying to anticipate his every move
the orc wield his axe menacingly and gave an evil laughter
fle be fo ma da wil na de fet ma
his voice boomed loudly as he made his unstoppable assault
mansuetus parried with every ounce of strength and speed he could muster
strands of hair flew as he avoided the humongous axe only by an inche
he saw an opening and made a riposte attack only to see his blade bouncing harmlessly off the orc tough hide
what would appear a grin appeared on the orc ugly face
beads of perspiration dripped down his delicate face
he was panting heavily and he felt he could not hold off the assault anymore
his bones ache like a rusty mechanism
his green skin foe seems to be tireless only to be laughing and fighting
fear gripped him like a vice
his eyes were wide opened he groaned in pain
blood streamed down from his open wound
every strands of strength was sapped away from him he could no longer feel his legs and his limbs were drained
he dropped his axe and crashed into the ground
mansuetus took moments to realize that a shadowy figure was at the standing at the back of the orc general
he wanted to laugh at the moment but could not
from the shadows came a calmed voice thou have done well mansuetus champion of fifth regiment of the shadow warriors
only to realized he was the assassin whom his general had spoken well of mansuetues made a courtly bow and said i thank thee for thine compliment for if thou wouldst have saved me and i wouldst have fallen to these cursed orcs
the battle is over assemble the elves and have them report back to the camp immediately he spoke softly
mansuetus nodded and said yes my lord
mansuetus walked into his simple house he took off his armour and took his scabbard and hang it by the side
mansuetus you are finally home i was so worried about you
mliara said excitedly as tears swelled in her eyes
she was a beautiful woman with striking features and fine figure
she ran over to embrace him and kissed him deeply
fatigue of the battle and heat of love conflict and he spoke softly i missed you greatly but i am tired now i wish to rest
he gave a reassuring smile and wiped the tears softly away from her face
i have prepared your clothing and when you have finish bathing we can have a good feast tonight
he took up his fresh clothing and walked over to the river
he could see the clear water flowing gushing down the endless river
the wind blew softly and the leaves rustled
he stripped off his bloodstained tunic and entered the refreshing water
he rested on the rocks by the riverbank and enjoys the peaceful and soothing ambience
life was too perfect for a moment he had a caring and lovely wife and recently he was promoted to captain of his regiment
the extra income would provide a better life for his wife and he himself
he opened his eyes lazily not knowing for how long he had slept
suddenly sound of splashing water made him jumped to his feet
he quickly put on the robes his wife had sewn for him and with drew the dagger in his boots
he sneaked among the bushes his natural talents made him moving like a cat among the bushes
he crouched down and to his horror he saw bands of men dressed in barbaric helms and leather clothing wading through the river
he quickly made his way back to his house and put on his battle equipment
he and his wife quickly made their way out of the house
every second lost would mean life and death
they ran as fast as their legs could carry them
suddenly shouts could be heard
mansuetus heart raced as he knew the enemy had spotted them
mliara tripped on a piece of rock and fell blood was spotted on her knees
mliara shouted the battletrained warrior
ther mansuetus you mustcarry on she slurred as tears burst forth from her
my love i cannot go on without you if we must die we must die together
he ran back and carries her on the back
you cannot run fast enough if you would carry me they would soon catch up with us
perspiration streamed down his face muscles tensed as he ran with all his might
sound of his pursuers came closer and closer he knew with every step they make they would be one more step towards the city
the chaos men were coming closer and closer
he fought on against the endless tide
what would have seemed forever he thought ended with a loud thud sound
droplets of blood glittering in the sun spurted forth
grief and sorrow overwhelmed him
he stopped and slowly put her down by the side of a tree
an arrow protruded through her chest
im sorry my loved one she said drawing all the energy within her
her eyes closed and he knew she was dead
he gripped his sword and there was a glint of madness in his eyes
blood course through his veins
he invoked the name of khaine and turned around to face the chaos worshippers
a muscular man held a bow in his hand and smiled happy that he had shot the target but soon his smile was gone as he head rolled off to the ground
mansuetus captain of fifth regiment of the shadow warriors fought with frenzy and hatred
he was cutting left and right beheading anyone who come within the tip of his blade
the chaos worshippers soon learn to fear him they surrounded him and no one dared to attempt an attack
he glared menacingly at his foes if it was as if just a look of his eyes to even cause fear in the heart of a stout dwarf
he swings his blade in a sinister way
light danced off from his bloodforged armour the runes on his sleeves glowed brightly
instead of waiting he lunged forward skewering the groin and hamstringing another
more chaos men formed up around him
only rage and sorrow were gushing through him
in his eyes he knew no fear
regardless of his own life he charged into the tide
hacking and slashing and hewed a path though the chaos men
but slowly he was overwhelmed no matter how fast he could dodge or strike he was unable to
the chaos men swarmed down on him and held him tightly
he roared in rage and bit his teeth into his tongue the sweet taste of blood filled his mouth
veins were bulging up as he struggled frantically
a group of elves charged into the fray and it was all too much for the chaos worshippers
they turned and fled ignoring leaving their weapons on the ground
mansuetus lay on the ground filled with cuts and bruises
a huge scar was evidently marked on his armour only missing his flesh only by a few inche
his eyes were vacant he felt life has no meaning with the death of his wife
we spotted this band after a few peasants had sounded the alarm
we apologies for the late arrival
the leaders words contained sympathy and fear
he ordered two of his men to aid him to stand
their faced betrayed irritation as they tried to push it back
mansuetus staggered across to his wife and knelt beside her
tears swelled in his eyes as he buried his head in his wife hair
please wake up my love i beg of you
friends are like ships anchored their lines by the harbor each secrete their own goods revealing only the hull whether they bring wealth or disasters cannot be foretold some anchored for long others drift into the vast empty seas some grow stale and become constant companions
i looked upon the world a pulsing light growing every minute daring and brave was i i challenge its unknown might blood was spilled tainted the lands a new champion arises such was its might i was imprisoned chained to the bounds of eternity strength and life was drained from me the brightness in my eye flickered and faded sorrows and agony clenched my heart fatigue was my constant companion memories and nightmares haunted me the aura of it presence tremble me every moment flesh rot and hang from my whitish limbs the seductive allure of hell draws me towards it writing the last sentence of my life i watched my life flashed before me like a rat was i staring at the unassailable titan witnessing my blade turning to dust my armor my faith swept away with the currents my shield my honor is what i have left crows and vultures flew the skies covering the sun to an eclipse jokers and minstrels both sang and mock at my foolishness perusing his poems and studying mine looking down at my own demise drowned my heart and soul
church bells rang of my failures rows of empty seats marked my mind sorrows came instead of prayers vanishing briliance of gems faded my eyes tapestries hung torn and tatteredworn my facade tainted walls wounded my soul flames flickerd against the winds and darkness flown with the chill
splinters love dawn of the sun is the end of night the end of summer is the onlslaught of winter so many times when you love someone even loving was painful when the love was broken so much does the splinters of love hurt the heart the birth of love is the dawn of joy and the end of love is the renewal of pain
the puppet his eyes sparkled a smile brightened his face he danced in the lucid night twirling and spinning he sang songs equal of a bard graceful was his movements and his soul and body became one kings and queens were dazzled by his arts servants and slaves paused in awe time drags on and kings yawned time and his mind became mine strings attached snapped and torned his purpose was fulfilled and so he was to end a smile faded his off his face
the deer eyes darted ears perked shuffling sound of dead leaves fingers of the frigid wind caressed the innocent soul muscles and sinews tensed watchful eyes watched its prey and wolves howl in triumphant dark clouds shrouded the moon shadows danced back and forth signalling the end
there have been times in my life when i have felt helpless
it is perhaps the most acute pain a person can know founded in frustration andand ventless rage
the nick of sword upon a battling soldiers arm cannot compare to the anguish a prisoner feels at the crack of a whip
even if the whip does no strike the helpless prisoners body it surely cuts deeply at his soul
we all are prisoners at one time or another in our lives prisoners to ourselves or to the expectations of those around us
it is a burden that all people endure that all people despise and that few people ever learn to escape
i perhaps are one of them who cannot escape the bound of reality
sometimes living for others seems like the only choice we in life are chained by society and law
do we have to follow
five for fighting song i cant stand to fly im not that naive im just out to find the better part of me im more than a bird im more than a plane im more than some pretty face beside a train and its not easy to be me i wish that i could cry fall upon my knees find a way to lie bout a home ill never see it may sound absurd but dont be naive even heroes have the right to bleed i may be disturbed but wont you concede even heroes have the right to dream and its not easy to be me up up and away away from me well its alright you can all sleep sound tonight im not crazy or anything i cant stand to fly im not that naive men werent meant to ride with clouds between their knees im only a man in a silly red sheet digging for kryptonite on this one way street im only a man in a funny red sheet looking for special things inside of me inside of me inside of me yeah inside of me inside of me im only a man in a funny red sheet im only a man looking for a dream im only a man in a funny red sheet and its not easy its not easy to be me
the hierachical order blades tore skies apart lightning splits the wounded bird silent winds swept the lands asunder angry clouds darkened the skies scythe of reapers plough the cities lucid dreams haunted in forms of echoing shadows treachery spoke louder than compassion every corner was a silent dagger and a coup practiced neater than a courteous bow even masters contorted in fear while slaves waited for the darkness to descend shadows rise and fall unendingly
unsurprisingly it is the 14 of june
i have been spending my time most often in npcc but many things have past that worthed my attention and pondering
the angel well over my days i must say i have valued and tried to learn as much as possible
i read the book woman cant read maps and men just cant listen
haha strange choice ehh it made me understand the difference between men and woman and why such difference exist and what we can do to prevent pressing the red button
now i move on to a new book written by a famous and good writer r
a salvatore who wrote many good series
i have only managed to the first book among the hundreds
other than that it has been most satisfying to win another battle against the odds
perhaps i have played too long and the expierance have been instilled upon me or perhaps my opponent needed more time
another attributes which i have gained over the days was being able to control myself over problems and everything
being composed in difficult or tough situations is a most useful skill
i have to thank warhammer for that
haha the devil there are always evil thoughts which sprouted in my youthful mind
sometimes it pays to heed its call but i must not be misled
now i realise more that firends are the essential ladder steps to climb to the top
but perhaps it is nothng more than a evil thought
still it makes sense other than simple ladder steps friends provide companionship and someone to talk to
now i must try to get rid of it
begone creature of hell the dark since from last week my good cousin or rather my best friend had left for army
i miss his companionship and a listener for my sorrows and joys and nevertheless some good laughters
still i cant change anything it is beyong my capability to prevent it
though i was glad that he was positive about it instead of frowning
npcc has took up most of my time spending my time sitting on iron steel chairs and listening to chants
much time is wasted a good thing is i can practice my body language reading
managed to read a few but still im not very good at it
the shooting competition was of my msot regret in this past ten days yes it was the most regretful thing
i didnt expect that i have enough time so i didnt aim for the shooting competition
i have only managed to score a score of 93 which was fairly poor although i pass
i didnt try my best was the worst mistake i have commitednow i truly wish for a time machine
knowledge pages withered wise and old pages flipped dust fluttered high and low worn and tattered hid its view from common man centuries flickered in the light of words the wise wrote its course and the lesser ones seek its enchantment
truth of reality as i sat on the sun set hill how the scenery seems mundane compared to you looking into your enchanting eyes the presence of you gladdens my heart and your words sweeten my soul time stopped parallel to space holding your warm hands seeped the strands of love you are the one who im willing to sacrifice for upon the altar of love to brave through the flames of hell to don the shinning armor and be your knight to hear your sorrows and despairs to understand and love you but when the dawn of reality shines upon me how i realize this was all an elusive dream there is no everlasting love no true love every lie renders me apart leaving me torn and tattered in an inevitable demise dark devils fed my soul and men mocked my foolishness winter now prey upon the land leaving it bare and dead life faded into the whispering wind

power of love they say angels birth from hell and devils warp from heaven no one knew the truth when time fled into space and space into time none shelter it with concern when love seeks to blind the heart of the lonely one none forsee its path as the blinding of love unbind it self the legends of knights in shinning armor reincarnated the soul of saints rebirth and the blessing of the gods shone once again such awe and splendour hidden in the seed of love itself
flashes of life the winds blew the memories of the dead the past flashes like a train emotions swelled to pain sadness and joy familiar faces carved into the graves something emerged triumphant the icy cold swept up in a torrent devouring the warm and lush air like a man frozen with no feelings thoughts nor love
i drunk myself with wine
they say there is nothing we cannot overcome in life what of times when steel of determination were cut open by the blade of love fallen so many times to dark pits hurt torn and shattered
they say men should have no fear but to me the world was divided by fears fears that could end everything fears that others would not understand and i fear that love could end a friend why must the tears linger for the winters chill when will the sun shine the light when will the rain wash away all the wounds
it was her face which etched clearly in my mind
shower of rain hid tears of a man clouds of bewilderment cover truth from lies where his smilenbspsecrete every sorrow
love present past and the future where art thou i left my dreams and hopes as the light shimmer of memories to a new land i am there smashing the mirror i knew there was no way back ruins of past and present lay before me am i to find the one who i love and who love me not in the midst of the sunless lands where the wind seems an absent vacuum and the air tainted with death my home i do not know there seems not a presence of a smoke nor shadow as i tread lifeless waste i found a charcoal sheet upon it wrote july 2 year 3210
love never dies a natural death
it dies because we dont know how to replenish its source
it dies of blindness and errors and betrayals
it dies of illness and wounds it dies of weariness of withering of tarnishing
there were so many times when i look into her eyes but yet she shun them from me so many times is there an end i knew i must leave but where perhaps somewhere where i can find love and care or perhaps a dark corner where i can cry alone i do not know
treading upon the silent street hands warmed by my side eyes cast down every step leads me into the oblivion the lingering pain in my heart was my solitude companion and none could take it from me
fatigue reverberate though the ear deep lines of wrinkles carved in depth dark lines embedded by the eyes pensive thoughts swam in the hollow pool influx of memories flooded like streams of river yet tainted and impure it was strands of white brushed softly against the wind and eyes faded to dark thoughts where death stalks in the shadow wisdom and knowledge dwindled into the vast ocean
are we the slave to our mind in lifegoing towards directions that we knew were wrong yet we went ahead
when you love someone even when you know there will only be pain you yearn for her listen to her voice listen to her sorrows and sacrifice everything for her happiness
slave we are to the mind holding us to the chains of the overmind
even when the one you love betrayed you often we would just cling on to the illusion which our mind fed us
love is such a strange feeling no amount science or maths can measure or decipher what it feels like
even words could not descibe
the ones you love most is the ones who hurt you most prince of shadow
standing by the window watching the bright stars shine their light seeing her face in my mind listening to the song of the nightingale feeling the soft caress of the wind dwelling in solitude pieces of puzzle fixed on piece by piece i knew so many answers yet i fear to face them call me a liar a fool but i hear not of them if there was a chance to spin the wheels of time to reach the tunnel of past and present to staunch wound which bleed in my heart i would still say
when i saw everything cumbling before me
im at work eating lunch right now
a turkey scamich and a courage sobe those commies dont have green tea in the machine
i have been thinking about writing another game but dont know what to write
i thought about doing a combat clone like the old atari 2600 combat tank game but that is a little too basic
a big problems i have with making games is my lark of a real artist
i gave up on my rolling thundertm style game because it was really hard to stay excited about a bunch of odd chapes moving around on the screen
i want to make an adverture type game with swords and stuff but thats probably because ive had zelda on the brain recently
i wonder if the zelda games are named specifically after zelda fitzgerald
i guess ill never know
i like top down shooters maybe ill make another one of those
earth defender b was kinda lame though it still ranks as my only game with sound effects
for the people reading what kind of 2d game would you like to see maybe a puzzle game i dont know
welli just got out of my last class of the semester
the final wasnt that hard except for one problem that i didnt do because i didnt even know where to start
the only class im worried about is linear algebra or as it should be called hard ass shit that ill never remember and barely understand in the first place
man i thought calc 2 was tough
ill take problems dealing with the surface area of graphs rotated into 3space any day over these problems
i really hope i get a c or b in this class
if i did worse on the final than i though then i could get a d
if that happens then this semester is a total waste
i need so many more math classes than anything else that to not pass one puts off my graduation by one more semester
the fact that i cant take any math classes this summer semester is for me a total travisty
add to that the fact that i cant take any classes this summer and im pretty bummed about that
i was hoping to at least be able to take another yoga class or a programming class or an art class
but no nothing fits my work schedual
i feel like i should want to party because im done with school for a little while but i really dont
as much as i cant stand individual people i like to be around people in general and school is a great way to do this
now ill have nothing to do on tuesdays and thursdays
i guess i could look for another job for the summer but that would be lame too
ohh shit i got it i can try being a dealer at a casinoive always wanted to do that
man that would be so sweet i would be standing there and be all like sir would you like to hit or stand
and he would say hit me and i would give him another card and then i would probably say ohh sorry sir i guess you shouldnt have hit and then ill take his money
the only problem is that the only casino within driving distance for me is casino san pablo and playing blackjack there is like playnig golf underwater it doesnt work the way its supposed to and it just isnt fun
well now i dont have anything to do for several hours
ohh well maybe i should just be depressed about it or something
i cant believe that no one has commented on my zelda post
surely im not the only one that sees not only one but the prospect of two new zelda games as momentous news
there is indeed something wrong with this world
i was much later for work than normal today my alarm clock may be broke or something
it better wake my ass on time for my comparitive politics final tomorrow
i brought home a broken palm m515 or some similar model number from work today with high hopes to take it apart and finally get a part i need to fix my palm zire 71
after 30 minutes of using various tools to break apart the palm i finally extracted the tiny ribbon cable that i needed only to find that the connector on one end is different
what a bunch of damn communazi jerks
i was so let down
i wasnt even mad at first
oh well its not like ill die without a pda
yesterday i was driving somewhere and mongolia crossed my mind
i realized that i knew nothing at all about the country
i have a vague notion that at one point in history mongol hordes swept across the land killing a bunch of people and stuff but after they got beat back did they just become hermits when was the last time you rememberanything happeneing there or them doing anything at all in the world never
after mongolia i started thinking about portugal
you never hear anything about portugal either
i can understand mongolia its way the hell out of the way near siberia
it may even be part of russia or china these days
but portugal man theyre right there on the edge of europe
i never hear anything and i mean anything about portugal
i remember talking about wwii in school
we leraned that spain was neutral during the war we knew about how pretty much every european country stood every one aside from portugal
what happened to them did they just vanish after the age of exploration
has anyone bothered to check since im obviously on the internet right now i know that i could just read about these places but that would be too easy
i think its time that t
started informing us about countries that it doesnt really talk about already
we need to hear about mongolia portugal estonia and others i dont know that name of because i never hear about them
ive just checked out the page for the new zelda game and i have to say that i cant wait for it to come out
after the big pile of dog poo that was the ledgend of the windwaker im so glad that they decided to make the zelda game that people want not try to reinvent the series as a cartoon that you play
at first when looking at the screenshots i was a little confused
i thought hey these are screenshots of a link to the past
then i realized that there wernt four links in that game
however this game does indeed use many of the same graphics that were used in link to the past
hopefully it will also include the dark world and stuff though this game looks prettty triforce free
well i guess you cant have everything even though i really really would like to have the triforce of wisdom
oh yeah stuff has happened in my life since yesterday but it hardly seems worth talking about considering this zelda news
update i have learned that there is another zelda game in the works
this one is 3d and looks like it will give little kinds and grownups alike nightmares that will put them off sleep for days
just check out the screenshots the one with link fighting the giant ass demon looked scarey as hell
i saw that guy and figured it had to be all over for link i really dont see how the little guy can pull off a victory aginst what looks like a 5 story building of a demon
ohh man i cant wait for this shit
i wish i could freeze myself in carbonite or something untill this shit comes out
read this and rejoice unless you live in south carolina thats right folks coming soon to a south carolina near you christian fundamentalism they plan to break away from the nation to form an independant christian country lets all pray that they get it
im sick of my federal tax dollars going to other states and having them still look down on california its like hey assholes we may have a screwy economy but were still the piggy bank of the nation where do you think you get your farm subsidies stalin claus
shit were california like the ugly stepchild of the us we give all our money and get back insults in return
well its time to rejoice that one of the other jerk states is going to bail
as an added bonus they are supposedly taking 50000 nutjobs away from other states
woohoo youre going to stop taking our money and remove a bunch of nutjob chiristian fundamentalists
can i donate to your cause
well i guess i lied
i have been updating this blog more even than the others i know with blogs update theirs
i guess i should have called it dont read my boring ass blog that has bad spelling and doesnt have any updates you will care to read because i never really do anything important anyways
but that title seems a bit long
before i forget id like to give a big shoutout to isabella wunder for linking to me though she could have used slightly better link text than boring ass but i guess you have to take it how it comes
id also like to give a big shout out to miss macy and ember i guess the benicia crew is in da house or off the hook something
reguarding my dreams it seems that my sunconscious picked up on my distaste for my recent dreams and game me a little treat last night
i had a dream i was playing a dope ass team based fps similar to tribes but with really good graphics and you could control players with your mind
however it wasnt all good i had to put the game system together before i could play the game and even then my step dad was watching the whole time grunting about wanting to watch tv
dont get any peace anywhere
lately ive been having the more boring lame dreams ever
being stuck trying to turn right at a country road stopsign trying to play pool but not being able to find a pool que arguing with someone about the use of mercenaries in the war in iraq
while im sure that all this is just dripping with deep meaning and insight both into my own mind and into the true nature of human society i just with that the way this insight were conveyed was a little more interesting or exciting
why cant i have dreams where im superman or something and i just fly around and save people
that would be so rad
anyways my subconscious mind aparently wants me to know that hiring mercenaries in iraq is cheaper than sending our own troops because we dont have to pay for six months of training during which time we have no extra troops
i hadnt thought about this point before having it told to me in a dream odd that a part of me is spending time thinging about arguemnts to support things im against
sometimes i fancy myself as a fiction writer
and since fiction is more interesting than describing the fact that i took some test yesterday or that i talked to someone the i hadnt seen in a while i guess i can write some here and have almost no one read it anyway
i removed the story i was writing it was leaving the realm of bloggable short story and entering the realm of longish tale
plus it was boring and uninspired
i still like the idea of the story with only really reflects the experiances ive had in office work
its funny how you got to places and everything seems to run smoothly but then you get a job there and you realize that its like one big balancing act and its amazing that everything doesnt come crashing down all the time
my favorite was when i work in customer service
man i didnt know crap about the products people were asking me about no one did
i just read this story and i have to say that i dont normally get this pissed of at the sad state of affairs anymore but this one really got me going
it seems that this principal fancies hiseld as the thought police for the school
one person wrote a poem he doesnt agree with and not only does he call the student unamerican fires the teacher that sponsers the poetry club terminates the teaching of poetry in the school but also removes all student art from the walls of the school and doesnt renew the contracts of teachers that leave art in their classrooms
i cant believe that this commie has the nerve to call someone unamerican
unluckily for you you have somehow landed here on my blog
i fail to grasp why one would want to read my blog however i have to admit that i dont exactly have the most favorable view of blogs that can be had
i have been known to say and still say that they are one of the biggest wastes of time known to man and one that offers the fewest rewards
so why then am i posting this well for two reasons one i wanted to post comments on another blog that doesnt allow anonymous comments and two im the one wasting your time
i have to think about my life anyways now im making you do it too
after reading this news story i knew i had to write about it for a couple different reasons
first off as long as she isnt butt ugly i doubt many boys were very thrown by this punishment
i know i know it damages them physomindaly or something but come on how many boys alreay have little fantasys about their teachers and now they have one asked if then want to be caned or to suck on her breasts
man some guys would shoot their loads just thinking about that setup
all joking aside it always irks me how little attention is payed to woman on boy sexual abuse
i know this took place in another country but it happens here and it never gets the same kind of media coverage or reaction than when the perpetrator is male
its strange to think that every person is like a walking universe
every person sees things through their own perspective and with their own thoughts coloring what they see
you would think that with all this uniqueness of thought and perspective going around there would be many different personalities and a real sense of individualism to go with it but theres not
for as far as people have gone group affiliation still seems to be a driving force in society
its like once we stopped living in tribes and towns got too large for everyone to know everyone else we had to create tribes of our own and in order for these tribes to have meaning and consistency in our large society each member of these neotribes must conform to an even stricter set of guidelines than would be necessary in an average tribal society
its funny how every group seems to think that they are unique and that they are true individuals however most members of a group almost always dress the same or at least very similarly
i swear to god that if i see one more of those you laugh at me because i am different i laugh at you because youre all the same shirts im going to barf all over the person wearing it and them that im laughing at them because they think theyre different while wearing a shirt that could have its own wearers convention ive seen so many people wearing it
every person has the capacity to have so many interests its not funny sometimes i think i bore people to death talking about my own but ive noticed that many people never seem to have any real interests
its almost like people are afraid of being kicked out of their neotribe if they express an interest in something that none of the others like
each group has its own safe area it could be literature music clothes style whatever and you will often hear people talking about those things but not so much about other things
i think its important to note that im not talking about friends there is a difference between a group like the neotribe that im talking about and a group of friends
its also important to note that my friends kick ass and that im not talking about any of them
however i am talking about many people i do to school with at dvc
its strange to walk around campus and hear people talking about the dumbest most meaningless shit
its even stranger to try to talk with people and try to talk about meaningful things not like the meaning of life or anything just about things that actually interest people what they plan to do after school where they grew up hobbies
and have them get all uncomfortable and leave
i dont know if people think im hitting on them or what but almost every time i talk to someone like an adult with full comprehension abilities rather than talk to them like they are children how are you i like your hat the sky is nice
they end up looking at me like im nuts
the other end of that spectrum are people that try to talk about the craziest thing they can to prove how different they are
somehow these people annoy me even more than people that talk about nothing because it just seems that they are forcing something that isnt there
it would be as if i talked about the goatse man with everyone i met
this is kind of a continuation of a previos story line in my blog and has to do with my job
if my readers will remember i have been in trouble with my boss for not doing a good job and coming in late and basically being a bad horrible person
well imagine my surprise when i came to work today to find a spirit award sitting on my desk
these are given out to employees that capture the spirit of the hospital workplace and go above and beyond what is expected of them
do they know who they gave it to the best part is that it can be handed out by any manager and i got one from my bosses boss
this doesnt change my work situation at all but man was i surprised
ive been working on my new game for a little while now its coming along okay
i have a lot of good ideas and am starting to flush them out before actually setting about writing them into code
recently ive been working on implementing a 2d sdl based particle engine
ive had a few problems because unless i use single pixels for particles i cant figure out how to color them
so i would have to have different particles drawn in each color i would want or have all particles be the same color
its so much easier to do in opengl
half the game effects i have planned are particle effects so if i cant figure out how to do them in sdl i may have to do the partiels in opengl i know there is a way to use opengl with an sdl window i just hant read up on how yet
right now im working on this game less than any others i have worked on in the past
by this point in time on my missile command clone i had already finished an opengl particle engine and setup all the particle effects i would use in that game
my lack of work is mostly because i spend more time playing pool than doing almost anything else aside from sleeping and working
i need a laptop that can boot and get on my network in about 5 seconds that way i could just transfer to my laptop and take it with me everywhere
but its too much work shuffeling code around all the time and wanting to go out but having to wait for the laptop top boot and then copy over the files
if the usb on my home computer actually worked i guess i could just use a thumb drive to move things around
but alas it does not work
asus makes some great boards but this one isnt exactly the greatest
maybe i should buy a new motherboard and processor and shuffel this one to my windows system
my birthday is coming and a nice new asus board with a gig of ram would look mighty fine under the tree
with a nice p4 ohh man that would be so sweet
the only thing sweeter would be a dual processor board with two nice p4s nad two gigs of ram and maybe a 10 gig solid state hard drive
well time to go play some pool i guess
at least i did write a few lines of code today
yesterday was all in all a pretty good day
even if certain people that needed certain rides to work from certain hospitals didnt give me money for gas or the bridge
i took the oppratunity to go to lunch with my mom since i was in the east bay anyways and its been a while since ive gone to lunch with her
i then went to codys books in berkeley and looked at surprise some books
for the purpose of suspence i will not reveal what the book that i bought was untill a later date
i went home played some video games and took a long nap
that nap ended up screwing me in the end
i woke up went to kinders and talked to a couple friends for about 5 minutes before heading off to a pool tournament
i ended up taking second place and wining a heafty sum of 35
not too shabby considering that i got lucky in quite a few games
but thats just the way it goes sometimes you get the bear and sometimes it gets you
i guess i got it last night but it wont be long before it gets me back
i ended the night be getting a sticky sobe from wolves and talking to miss macy for a little bit
i went home played some more video games and went to bed to try to sleep something which i failed miserably at
its now the morning of today and i got about one or two hours of sleep
i guess the bear did get me back
while i was in bed he is a jerk
well today is my last day of forced vacation from work and im kinda glad to go back because the heat is killing me
i wanted to do more with the past week then just hand out like normal
but its hard to find people that want to get out and do stuff early in the day especially when youre not so sure you want to yourself
is it getting hotter its 400pm i figured it would start cooling off but my house defies me again and shows it self for the oven that it is
roasted griffenjam is on the menu tonight
i got the new zelda game four swords adventures last week
it came with a free shirt and im wearing it now for the third time this week i did wash it yesterday though so that is no excuse to stay away from me
the game is alot like the new harry potter movie
its really good for what it is but dont try to compare it to anything else in the series or in the movies case the book because it just wont live up
in practice its very much like final fantasy mystic quest
which was the worst final fantasy game ever
dislike the most is that you cant just walk around the world at your leisure
you have to select a specific are to go to then select an available section and clear it to move on to the next area
i dont like games that are too controlling let me do my own thing dammit
a link to the past kicks this games ass so hard the bruises may never go away but like i said its fun for what it is
my and isabellas birthday is coming up soon
im wondering if my dad will call i doubt he will but i hope he does
its normally pretty easy to milk an absent parent for good gifts or cash as long as they feel bad about being absent
however i didnt even get a card for christmas so i think that i may be out of luck
i wonder what the etiquette is with crappy dads when it comes to the rest of the family
my grandmother his mom is having everyone at her house for her birthday soon and i was invited
i want to go but i dont know
i always get the feeling that im a little set apart from them except for grandma
for example im the only liberal in a very conservative family im also the only nonbaptized one
i also know that if i go ill just get even more mad at my dad than i already am
like last time i went up
some cousins and i were playing softball and then one of them said something about playing softball with my dad recently
this was funny because my dad lives in arizona and she doesnt
that means that my dad came to california and at some point played softball with her something he hasnt done with me and never even called me
before that day i thought it was the entire family that he ignored but during that trip i found out that it was just me
everyone kept asking me about what i thought about things hes been up to or have happened to him
all of it was news to me
ohh well what can i do but if he thinks hes getting my liver or any other organ someday he can think again
i dont want to make a habit of posting news stories but this is one i felt i just had to share
it would seem that in the year 2003 the second full year of our all out war on terrorism the amount of terrorism used in the world actually increased
they tried to lie about it and say that the level of terrorism had dropped lower than it has been in 34 years but someone called them on it and now they look pretty dumb
this is exactly what i have been saying will happen
a war on terrorism will only increase the number of people that are willing to use it to acheive their aims
so in my last post i said i had a meeting with my boss that i thought was going to be bad
due to my nonstop lateness and over the top internet useage ive been suspended for two days
while i think that suspension was a little harsh i could use a little time off
the only thing that bugs me is that im not the only one in my department that does this stuff
im just the most obvious one
hell one person plays flash games all day
another gets off the phone from yelling at his wife just long enough to call someone regaurding his after hours work
ohh well i guess thats what it means to be low man on the totem pole
enough about that now its time to tell about me being hasseled by the man
the other night i was driving home from playing some pool and i see a cop driving around i say to isabella hes going to pull me over
low and behold he does
i wasnt doing anything wrong nothing at all
he tell me that the computer says that my registration is expired
just to make it totally clear i had registred my car a week previous and considering that the police had a connection to the dmv computers right in their car i find it hard to believe that my registration is showing up as expired
he eventually lets me go
last night just two nights after the first incident after leaving a pool tournament which i didnt win i see a cop and he sees me walking to my car
he pulls around in a parking lot and waits for a few seconds watching me then he leaves and goes up the street out of sight
hes out of sight for all of five seconds and i see his front end creep around the corner watching me start my car and let it warm up for a minute
the second i drive off hes on my ass
i love it when cops tailgate me so i try to be carefull not to do anything stupid but in the end i kinda do
im at a red light and and i see a car coming but it looks far enough away that i think i can safely turn right
he pulled me over and asked for my license
this piqued my interest because he didnt ask for my registration
i would have thought that if my registration was showing up as expired he would have said something about it but even after checking the computer and coming back with my license he didnt ask for it
he just told me to yeild next time and let me go
god i love the cops in benicia
i live in vallejo and drive around that city all the time at all hours but never get pulled over there
i go one town over and it happens quite often
i have a meeting with my boss in about 10 minutes
i always hate meeting with authority figures
i have a feeling that this will be bad
its a follow up to a meeting i had previously with her when we discussed how late i always am ive been late alot lately
in my defense ive been sick lately and its harder to get up and around early when youre sick
i dont know how to tell her that without sounding like im just making excuses which is something i really dont want to do
i guess it doesnt matter really
this place isnt known for handing out raises so its not like im going to miss a chance at a raise because im a bad employee and i dont think im quite fireable yet
though that would really suck
id hate to have to turn to selling my body to pay rent
its funny how much time can change you without you realizing it
when i was 17 i had the world figured out i was the person i really wanted to be and couldnt imagine ever wanting to change
i was going race people on the feeway with my vw bug for the rest of my life
i was going to do other things too but i was sure that racing my bug was going to be a big part of my life forever
well two accudent later i no longer had a bug to race and its really hard to look like a straigt up hardcore pimp driving a bonneville and it was so easy in a vw bug
now that i have a car that can race i find that i never actually want to do it
maybe im just afraid that ill get in a wreck and die i mean how fast could i really go in a vw bug heh actually its funny for how much one changes how much of them stays the same
i remember when i was young maybe in third grade i used to be afraid that when i grew older i would turn into someone else
that somehow the voice inside my head would be different and not connected to the one i had at that time
i was afraid of being older like 15 or 16 i didnt know how to do it then
it all seemed very scarey
i would be expected to do things and know things about the world
like how to pay taxes and register cars
i would be expected to know how to spell well i guess i cant get everything right
when i made it to 15 the last thing i wanted was to be 18
there were breif moments when i wanted the freedom that being 18 would bring but those moments didnt last long
i didnt have a large college fund 1000 doesnt even go far at community college and i knew that none of my parents would be kicking down the many thousands that it would take to send me to school
i also knew that my grades werent good enough to merrit and kind of scholership worth talking about
this all ment that i would have to work for a living when i turned 18 which actually turned out to be when i was 16 and even thought i hadnt done it yet i knew one thing anout work it was for suckers
ten jobs later i have only confirmed that work really is for suckers
i know that a blog is supposed to be like a diary
a log of events in your life but i find my typical day to be too mundane to talk about
i dont mean to diminish the importance i place on hanging out with my friends thought
i saw a few of my friends yesterday and last night and i really enjoy it every time im around my friends
whether its going to the mall and getting a bit to eat or sitting around shooting pool and trying to win stuffen animals the time i spend with my friends is the most important time in my life
that is something that has never changed about me and i hope that it never does
i just got back from see the new harry potter movie and i guess ill say some words about it
i wont try to spoil anything but if your looking to be surprised then dont read this post like anyone reads these posts anyways
overall i thought the movie was good for what it was however it pays the book absolutely no service at all
some events are out of order happen in entirely different places or are completely missing
unless it was after the credits the trainride home wasnt even in the movie and that means that pidwidgen spelling wasnt either sorry ron i guess errol will have to do for now
quiddich was completely forgotten about after the first match which is too bad because i was really looking forward to seeing harrys patronus run down malfoy
actually many things arnt in the movie at all which i was expecting but it seems that too much is missing
time also seems to move very quickly
before you know it its christmas time but strangely enough it never actually is christmas
it seems that opening presants on christmas is a feature of every book but it didnt make it into the movie
sorry guys no sweaters from mrs
weasley or any other preasents
one thing i was sorry wasnt in the movie was the lack of normal interaction
you never really see the students in class unless there is a major event in that class
the books deal not only with the main story line but also with the life of harry and his friends in school this is something that is completely missing from the movie
i still liked it none the less
all my life ive had lucid dreams dreams which you can control however when i have them its fairly rare that i realize that im dreaming at the time
ladt night is a perfect example
i had a dream that i was arrested for some reason and thrown into jail this was a lucid dream however its hard to take control when you dont realize that you have any i thought it was real
i was totally freaking out wondering what the hell was happening
however it was that bad because every time i wanted anything i would find it right away
i was a little thirsty and instantly found a coke machine i wanted something to do and found a recroom filled with pool tables
i wanted something to eat and i just all of a sidden had food i dont even know where it came from
after a little while it turned out that i was in the coolest jail ever
somehow i missed that fact that there was a surprisingly small number guys in this jail and the majoiry of the population was filled with hot girls
how did i not reailze that i was dreaming
im staying home from work today my sickness i mentioned before has not gone away and i figure that if i have to deal with it for a while i may as well take a day of work
this sucks more than is immedatly apperent to anyone that doesnt work for communists
at the hospital i for at your sick time and your paid vacation all come out of the same bucket
the time im taking now is subtracting from my paid vacation time
that is so lame it makes me even sicker
its actually a very bad policy to have in a hospital
i wonder how many people in order to conserve vacation time go to work sick
their work which is where tons of people are that shouldnt be around anyone that is sick that they dont have to be
ohh well i dont make the rules i just try my best to not follow them
i saved some of the best news for last
last night i won a pool tournament
brought in a wooping 69
woohoo actually i got quite lucky and you can believe me when i say that because i think false modesty is one of the fakest things since mcdonalds cheeseburgers
it really rips me up when i know that someone is trying to be modest and saying things i know they really dont think
well i have to go i told isabella and materialgirl that i would come hang with them
dont do anything i wouldnt do
and if you do call me first so i can come and watch
as you may have noticed by the fact that it is plainly stated above i am in a bad mood
i couldnt sleep at all last night and when i did drift off for a short period of time i had a strange dream about optimus prime and i hiding in a room on a space station that looked surprisingly like the pharmacy at the hospital i work in
it seemed that most of the autobots were being mind controlled and they were looking for us
optimus wasnt in high spirits and neither was i
so im tired and cranky and i have a sore throat and so when i got to work i decided to do what any sane person would do at work and try to plan my class schedual for next semester
this turned out to be the wrong thing to do on an already bad day
budget cuts at school have now hit home for me
there is a greatly decreased number of tuesdaythursday classes and some of my favorite teachers arnt teaching the classes i need to take which is okay because the classes arnt at time i can take them anyways
why is it patriotic to blindly support every war bush takes us into but its okay to let education funding slide
wanna talk about patriotism how about putting some stock in this countries future and educating people for a change
our big bad weapons wont mean shit when others develop energy shields and were left behind because were a nation of dumbasses that dont care about funding education
i was going to talk about a bunch of other stuff but i just got blindsided by my bad day
i need to talk to a counselor about what classes i can take for my major now that i cant take the math class i need or the programming class i need
last sunday was the anniversary of the day of my birth
its not a global holiday yet but im working on it
i had a pretty good time
i had gone to lake tahoe with my parents my sister and her husband
i won some money on the first night i was there that was pretty cool
we went to nevada and saw some sights including the town that bonanza was filmed in
then we came back and went out on a dinner cruise in the lake
the food was alright except for the fact that no matter how anyone ordered the steak it came out medium well
but considering that it also came out within five minutes of ordering it i have an inkeling that it may have been already cooked and would have been hard to uncook it a little to make it med
the boat sports a small glass bottom that is too small to be of any use to anyone that isnt just trying to check on the color of the water under the boat
but it was a nicvee trip altogether and i enjoyed the views of the lake
i took lots of pictures as people normally do in that kind of setting then in five years ill probably do what countless others have done ill look at those pictures and wonder where the hell they were taken and what exactly i was taking a picture of because aside from trees and water there is nothing remarkable in the pictures
after we got back we all went gambling
the idea was to go together but we ended up going our seperate ways after long
i did well but wasnt making the millions i wanted to so i quit and walked to a pub that sports a pool table and figured id shoot a couple games
this was a great decision it turns out because i met two very nice girls from oakland in the pub
we shot a few games then decided to go gamble a little but on the way to the casino stopped off at a club called the cabo yabo or something or other
now i dont drink smoke or have sex with everyone i meet so the clubs have never really been my thing but we were having a good time nonetheless
i turned 26 standing in that club
we stayed there for a little over an hour then went to do some gambling
i lost a little money 6
and at 230am figured that it was time to go to bed
i bid my new friends farewell and left for the warm if not lsightly stiff embrace of my bed in my temporary home
i should have gotten their numbers but i didnt
ohh well maybe ill see them again
in the morning i went to a breakfast buffet with my family and had a pretty good breakfast
after that we gambled a little more i lost thirty dollars
then everyone left one group at a time with me leaving last
i came home ans went out with some friends to a local bar
aparentally i spent the whole night muggin staring in a menacing way people or so i was told repeatadly
for those that dont know and since everyone that reads this knows me im talking to no one thats likely to see this i play in a pool tournament every thursday night
last week i did pretty bad the word dismal comes to mind
losing is one thing but missing a bunch of easy shots is another
to put it plainly i just plain sucked
however this was a new week and my sucking seemed to have abated because i came out swinging this time and i was dropping fools like thats what they were made for
well i guess i could remember it that way if i were drinking or doing some heavy drugs
in reality i got lucky in alot of games and owe many victories to the person i was playing choking or getting really lucky with a leave
my luck ran out in the last two games
this is a double elimination tournament so that means everyone can lose twice and the winner of the winners bracket plays the winner of the losers bracket
this means that the last person in the winners brackets has to be beaten twice by the last person in the losers bracket which is exactly what happened with a little help from me
for me the only important shot in both those games was the last on of the second game
the eight ball was sitting on the side pocket and i had a clear shot at it
i took carefull aim and hit with just a little right english to make sure that i didnt follow it into the side pocket and took my shot
i had hit to hard and the right english carried the cue ball right down the table and into the corner
sometimes i feel like the whole thing is a luck game anyways
and thats all i have to say about that
so today i did stupid shit like waking up and going to work and coming home and stuff then i did something pretty cool
i went to see some bands play at blakes in berkeley
i ended up going by myself which is cool with me but stuff like this is always more fun with friends
ohh well at least no one i know saw me jogging down telegraph trying to find a place with a public bathroom i could take a crap in and not die from some disease five minutes later
i got there rather early and the show started rather late which ment that i did alot of standing around outside by myself before the show started
yet again i dont mind being alone
my dislike for humanity as a whole compells me to no talk to most other people and since im a pretty momentumy person my nontalkingness carries over to pretty much everyone even people i might like to meet
however this doesnt stop crazy people from talking to me and telling me about how they think that kurt cobain was alot like earnest hemmingway because both blow their brains out
but figuring that you just have to take it as it comes i just smile and say something like wow i never saw it that way
the bartender at blakes the girl that works on the main level has a very strange thing going on
i normally have a pretty good feeling about what people are like what kind of person they are and so on and this girl game me a really strange feeling but in a good way kind of like the buddah or something
i wanted to ask her a bunch of questions and try to figure her out but i figured that some creapy guy in a green hat asking where she grew up and what her favorite color is might seem at best like im some creapy guy that is hitting on her and at worst like some creapy loser that is wearing a strange hat and hitting on her
she was also cute and smiled alot i like people that smile at people they dont know i do it all the time but rarely get one in return
the first band that played was pretty good
there were from the east coast and played something that sounded very much like l
i dont remember their name though and i didnt care to get their cd i kinda had the feeling that they were jerks
this was confirmed when i saw them mocking the band that played after them sputter doll
sputter doll played a great set i really loved it
i felt kind of bad though because all the other bands were pretty much straight ska bands and here they were playing punk
i got the feeling that most of the people there werent really digging on them too much which is too bad because they sounded great
i wanted to get their new cd but they packed up and left before the band after them finished their set
which brings me to warsaw
i got a warsaw cd back in 97 and thought they were pretty cool
i had no idea they were still around untill today
they played a great set with a bunch of original sounding ska and even had someone playing a conch shell in one song
it was great to see all the people dancing and haveing a good time i know i was
however i really had been hoping to hear some of the songs on the cd i have but they only played recent stuff
like i said gotta take it like it comes no use complaining about it
after they were done i left i didnt really care to stick around for the next band
i drove to the pastime to play a little pool
which is exactly what i did play a little pool two games to be exact
once i got there i realized that i was too tired to stay for long
i played and them came home sucessfully getting out of benicia without getting pulled over
last night i was sitting on the can and had the thought that it might be a good idea to write about something that happened to me years ago just over ten years ago in fact
its about the first time i fell in love or at least thought i did
ill leave out many of the boring details because im told that they rather than adding depth and interest just make my stories long and drawn out
i was a youngster staying at a hotelcasino with a parent
this meant than while my parent was gambeling and doing whatever i didnt have shit to do
however i was a horny youngster so i went to hand out by the pool i didnt have a swimsuit but i figured that girls probably did
well while sitting by the pool i noticed a girl around my age who actually turned out to be a couple years younger sitting with her grandparents
she was very attractive in an offbeat sort of way i couldnt really put my finger on it or figure out why i thought she was so attractive but you dont really questions those things too much do you if you think someone is hot you dont really care why
well being a little wuss i knew that i wouldnt talk to her especially no in front of her grandparents so i didnt really think about it
now it becomes important to point out that i am and always have been a big ice eater
in my earlier years it wasnt uncommon for me to just get a cup full of ice and munch on that for a while something that i did at exactly this point in my story
i got up and got a cup full of ice and sat back down
about five minutes after that the girl got up and got some ice as well on her return trip to her seat she commented to me about how great the ice there was
this shocked the hell out of me because at that point and to a certain degree to this day i had the feeling that i was pretty much invisible and went unnoticed unless i walked into someone or something
at that moment nothing more came of that
her grandparents and her eventually got up and left i had nothing to do so stayed there for a while
there was a view of the river nearby from the pool area so i checked that out for a while
i eventually got bored and decided to walk around elsewhere
i left the pool area and hit the elevator button which was right on the other side of the door from the pool area when i heard someone say hi to me from behind
it was that girl we talked for a little bit untill the elevator got there
it turned out she was waiting for her grandparents
when the elevator arrived i really wished i could keep talking to her but i didnt know if i would look crazy if i called up an elevator and didnt get into it so i left
i kicked myself all the way to whereever i went after that
i did something ate dinner blaa blaa for the next few hours untill it was almost time for bed
i told my parent that i wanted to go for a walk which was true
i was told to be back by 10pm
i went back to the pool mostly because i wanted to see the girl but also because i enjoy being outside at night and looking at the stars even to this day i can sit outside and look at the stars for hours and not get bored
when i got there i found that i was the only one there i sat down and thought about things for a while then a door opened and she came out
we talked for a couple hours about all sorts of stuff
i found out that she was from seattle and her grandparents lived in sacramento
i cant remember her name im terrible with names and for some reason it completely slipped my mind to try to get her address
when midnight rolled around we both figured that we were probably in quite a bit of trouble for staying out so late and went back to our rooms
i was happy that i had met such a cool person but sad because i knew i would never see her again
i was actually depressed about this for a few days
i wrote in a journal at this time in my life and ill repete here the advice i wrote in my journal
if you take the time to get to know the perfect person at least make sure to get her address
well ive been working on my new game earth defender c for the past few weeks
i do it a little at a time im not a very hardcore developer these days
think i got this far with earth defender b within the first two or three days
but this game is going to be better developed and have a special quality that earth defender b didnt quite have this game will be fun to play
since i dont do much artistically that i can share with others i figure all i really have right now is my games so im going to post a screenshot so all can see my fledgeling game in all its glory
before you start dissing my game or me remember this is still very early on and that im not an artist
also the map isnt exactly laid out for looks right now
blaaa here is the pic
well im trying to sign up for classes and im having some problems
it seems that thanks to budget cuts all the classes i want are at times i cant take them
i can accept this for now
so im thinking that i will talk to a counselor and see what classes i need that are in times i can take them
so i call up and try to make an appointment
this was my big mistake
i expected a department in a college to do something that makes sense give advice to students before a semester starts
i was told that for now they are only giving appointments to people that are already taking summer classes
so in other words they are only helping people that already have classes and dont really need help
i was told that i couldnt make an appointment until school actually started and even then i can only make the appointment once school starts it would be weeks before i could actually see one
wtf so they only counsel people that have already made mistakes
hey glad you made an appointment to come see me ohh look at this you took all the wrong classes and wasted this semester should have talked to someone before signing up for these but now its too late to even add classes because not many teachers will let you after the first week
this makes no sense why only help people after its too late for the help to do any good why are there no sections of calculus iii at a time when i can take them not only at dvc but also at contra costa community college solano college and napa college
are there any others i can try and im tired of people that use its when they mean its if you want to say it is use its damnit the same goes with your and youre
and whats with yellow cabs anyways so what if its yellow doesnt have to be in the damn name does it
i just read this and found it pretty sad
this kid wants to go kill muslims
god i hope they dont let him into any branch of the armed forces just what we need some kid with his own muslim killing agenda
this is sad on so many levels its not even funny
normally when someone gets mad at things like immigrants or people of other races it mostly fear that drives it
normally fear that these people arent actually inferior to them and can do things just as well as they can
how many times do you hear highly skilled people go on about immigrant problems
not alot because they know they are secure in their job and arent afraid that someone that isnt acclimated to the culture and cant speak the language well is going to come and take their job away
as far as im concerned if you can be replaced by someone that cant speak english and only just got here then you probably didnt deserve your job in the first place
i also love how the same people that talk about wanting unfettered capitalism and a laissez faire government are also the same people that hate on the illegals
im sorry but you cant go on about the glory of the free market one minute then talk shit about people that are the living expression of it the next
illegals work harder for less money than most of this country they had to go through more shit just to get those jobs and they risk far more thanany of us ever will just by coming here in the first place
they embody free market capitalism they risk everything for a shot at a better life and they are willing to work hard for it
and because of them we have cheap fruits and vegetables
i dont hear anyone complaining about that you never hear anyone say damn those illegals these oranges should cost 10 times this much
the funny part of it is that we as a country support the illegals every day
if you buy fruit chances are an illegal picked it
do you shop at walmart guess who got busted for using a company that hires illegals
just like my answer to anything you dont like in our society if you want to do something the only real way to make an impact is to boycott
if you dont like illegals then dont buy anything they pick shop anywhere they clean or pay them for anything
personally i dont care about illegals like i said i know they arent taking my job
and im pretty secure in knowing that most americans are too lazy stupid and cheap to actually do anything effective about the illegal problem so all they will keep doing is talking shit
another thing i love in this country is people thinking they are better than anyone else on earth just because they are born here
im sorry but this kid has no room to talk about what other people should do or about how they dont deserve to live here
ive got news for you kid no one born deserves to live here some of us are just lucky
and before you start acting like the popular kid keeping the nerds out of your party i have to ask you what have you done to make this country great people go on and on about how great this country is and i dont disagree this is a great country but its not through their actions that its great
its thanks to people like thomas edison the wright brothers and thought i really hate to say it henry ford that this country is great
it has nothing to do with john q
asshole that does alot of talking but doesnt do shit worth talking about every country has those
until you do something worth talking about i dont really want to hear your views about who should be here and who shouldnt because for all we know the child of that fruit picker that came here illegally will invent something that will allow the u
to maintain its dominance in the world
it always amazes me how a country of immigrants could have so much hatred for them
as the title suggests i had a great weekend im just sorry that it had to end
i wont go into all the specifics but i hung out with bunches of friends and family and even saw la plebe play at the phoenix theatre in petaluma
i got to see my friend from the good ol state of oregon and her twins
i think of the twins charlotte is starting to like me but maggie still seems pretty wary of me
i got to see two parades this year vallejo and benicias
i think i can say without too much hometown bias that vallejos was the better of the two although both shared quite a few floats
i have a feeling that is the reason that benicia has its parade on the third because if it did it on the fourth many of its floats would be in vallejo
benicias after parade festivies beat vallejos handsdown though
in vallejo the vallejo symphony plays after the parade and there is like a minicrafts fair
in benicia there is literally dancing in the street as a rock band plays various other bands hits
i saw no crafts booths but there were a few food stands
there is one thing that benicia is missing and that is a ducky durby
i know i bought a duck from a person in vallejos parade thought i didnt go to the actual race
maybe my duck won that would kick so much ass
i would even love to get fourth place
hmmm i dont know what happened to my duck ticket though well they have my name and address
well this was a great weekend and im glad that i got to spend it with family old friends new friends and people that are just becoming friends
if every weekend were like this life would be grand and almost any lame ass job would be bearable because i would know that i had the weekend and great friends and family to look forward to
i know no one care about this but i will post about it anyways
i have been working on my game and its going somewhat well
since i posted that screenshot i have added such wonderfull and awe inspireing things as bullets and one enemy that doesnt have the ability to fire at you yet which is okay because its mostly just a flying bomb itself it has been named a spindrone
mostly because its a drone and it spins or it should
right now it just looks like a tweeker robot thing that is makeing strange movements that dont really resemble spinning at all
i am such a bad pixel artist it isnt even funny
well for other people its funny and i guess i do laugh sometimes at my own crappy art so i guess i should say that im such a bad pixel artist that its only occasionally funny and most time the horrors oof my art are beyond humor
maybe im going over the top a little but i dont think so
id post another screenshot but im lazy and no one would care so why bother
plus the game isnt that visually different yet
i need to work on the hud a little more and take all the debugging text of the screen and add another enemy or two then ill post another screenie for you all to ignore
btw if anyone that may be reading this is a pixel artist and wants to have their name in the credits of this game post your email addy and ill get back to you
a large chunk of the coding for this game is done everything i have do has been done with the idea of code reuse in mind
all i have to do is add support for a few things and the buld of the game will be finished so if an artist were to join up now if would be quick easy game credits to show their art in action
so after all im really the one helping you out not the other way around
so this week i took a break from doing absolutely nothing with my life to go to linuxworld and try to waste my time getting cheap linux related junk that will collect dust in my house
it was a great success
on tuesday lovelostlibra came with my and we made the rounds hitting up every booth we could gaining information and looking for cheap crap like it were the holy grail
some products i had a real interest in blackduck had a pretty cool app for programming teams and others that i couldnt care less about ahem
but only talked to to get the cheap crap
lll and i had a pretty good time i think maybe hes really plotting to get back at me for boring him to tears for bringing to a linux trade show who knows intel threw a pretty nice afterparty that had some great food and a pretty cool 80s cover band
they also had a bunch of freetoplay pool tables
we all had great fun and ate and drank and were merry and stuff
then we took bart bay area rapid transit its a train back to where i parked earlier
let me tell you that was the longest bart ride i ever had
i had to pee so bad my teeth were swimming in it
i ended up having to go in the womens restroom because there was someone in the mens room and there was no time for politeness for formality
if the womens had been locked i would have been peeing into a trashcan or something
thursday i went back to linux world on a solo mission of justice
i had been cheated of a great bounty of cheap shit the previous trip and i was coming back to clean house and clean house i did
four tshirts a bank a miniusb hub enough mints and pens to make mr
i especially liked the end of the conference on this the last day
the roles were reversed vendors were practically begging people to take their stuff so they wouldnt have any left over
i cant think of one piece of swag that i missed
there was no after party however ohh well
cant win em all ehh for lunch i ate at a mexican restaurant in the metreon
i had a chicken quesadilla and a sobe it came to just over 9
while eating i was forced to think about the mexican place i recently ate at in the mission
this food was bland and almost tasteless and very expensive while the food server just a couple miles away was authentic real and not very expensive at all
it made me sad to think that things would be so watered down for the people ate at this place
what mostly made me sad was how much i paid for this crappy food
i was telling miss macy about my idea that the smurfs were communist propaganda and she told me to write it in my blog so here it goes
first off you have papa smurf
he takes care of all the smurfs and coordinates the resources of the entire village
he also wears a red hat what a fucking commie
all of the smurfs have names that denote what they do in the village
handy smurf heafty brainy ect
they all do something even if its only just stand there and look good and no matter what they do they all get the same reward for their work
they all have the same house the same food and they all want to get some from smurfette but she aint givin up to any of them
i dont know what that has to do with communism but it still sucks all the same
now this brings us to gargamel
this is where it gets deep
gargamel is a capitalist that is always trying to make some cash by turning the smurfs into gold
or to put it more simply he wants to make money off of the hard working smurfs
if that doesnt scream bourgeois exploitation of the proletariat i dont know what does
i dont know what the hell those two prince kids represented but im sure its something communist
you are 10 evil how eviiiil are you thats right youre the meekest of the meek youre the least amount evil the philosophy in ying and yang is that no one person can be completely good or completely evil but youre pretty close to complete goodietwoshoes
what does everyone think of the new shpiel of the week column at the side basically its where i use a keyword and spin a paragraph around it
i got the idea from my friend jeff yen who picks a random word from a dictionary and writes a journal entry on it
i was his guest entry for this particular wordthreat which ive used as a starting point for my weekly shpiel
what do you guys think drop me a flooble yah
doli incapax and the 50egg cake i was at my friend joys blog the other day and read something interesting called doli incapax
basically it means that kids under the legal age of responsibility cant be held accountable for wrongful actions crime that they commit coz they cant yet tell right from wrong and may not understand what theyre doing
just what is the legal age of responsibility hmm
maybe the argument can be used for certain ahem 22 yearolds id love to plead that case
especially for me the bumbly butterfingered buffoon
well it was shawns 24th bday party today though his bdays tomorrow thats the surprise and i kept doing bumbly things
like dropping joys camera classic 3 stooges stuff biting into my plastic fork and worst accidentally hitting egenes stillrecoveringfromligamentoperation knee
after i was so careful not to
he was in pain you shouldve seen his face
oh and did i forget to mention that i left the sandwich maker on and it burnt through its own rubber insulated wiring how one day can go so wrong i dont know
and its not just today
im constantly making a fool of myself either putting my foot in my mouth or causingbeing involved in accidents
charles says i should just try to be more aware but as you can see from the knee hitting incident it makes no difference
im just bumbly lil ol me
enough of my whinging and whining
shawns party was pretty great organised by his girlfriend joy
we stuffed ourselves silly with party food like egg sandwiches pasta and nachos
and of course later the densest chocolate cake ever
it must have had 50 over eggs in it im extrapolating that figure after considering the fact that a block of peranakan kueh lapis has 30 eggs in it
i think the highlight of the party has to be the what do i hatelove about shawn part where everyone got to air their grievances
for more information check out his blog
lets just say we had a ball of a time
whatever it is we all had a great time
too bad shawn did all the cooking and cleaning up after
now thats what i call a good party when the birthday boy prepares his own surprise birthday celebration
no lah hes not that pathetic
he was only let in on it coz there was no way to get him out of the way
if you cant beat em join em doodeedoodeedoo
his pasta was pretty good though
bit of a borin ol read innit all rights thats all for today
sorry its a bit of a boring read so far only coz im too busylazy to write with my usual ahem creative flair
tune in after i finish me essays for a more updated look to this site and hopefully ill be able to add more interesting links n stuff
oh man just checked out my sis blog
man that girl is crazy
anyways thing is i followed the link to the which ep
2 character are you website and found out my true calling is to be
which episode ii character are you anakin skywalker jedi apprentice
like anakin you know your morals and usually always stick to the rules
however stray away from those who know best and you may become naiive to what anybody tells you
stay with those whom you trust and have always been your friends
otherwise you may find yourself being manipulated by outside parties
darnnit i really wanted to be obiwan kenobi ah wells
anyways do me a favour and take the quiz then let me know which character you are in the flooble msg box at the side
big event egene had his knee operation today to fix his torn ligament soccer soccer soccer
the bane of all knees
went with him in the morning and checked into st vincents private
not bad the room is pretty retro the wallpaper floor tv etc
he has his own room and bathroom so its cool
the meals are pretty good i know coz i ate his mmmm
yummy satay beef skewers on jasmine rice with peanut sauce caesar salad bread roll with butter fruit salad fizzy lemonade and clear consomme
he wasnt allowed to eat anything coz of the anesthesia
he could have had something to eat in the morning but coz we thought the op was at 11 or 12 the time he checked in so he didnt have anything to eat
in the end the op was actually scheduled for 4pm
anyways in the afternoon i left for the apple store came back but missed seeing him off to the operating theatre
it was about 5pm so i hung out at a cafe for the next couple hours then went to wait in his room and watched tv there
he came back about 8
he came back looking woozy and tired he was under general anesthesia after all
hes now on a morphine drip coz hes allergic to other painkillers and its selfadministered
wonder if anyone ends up euthanising themselves by accident
anyways thank god the operation went well
he seems fine and will probably be out on friday or saturday
check back for more details on this page just a quick update on my ibook situation
yesterday i ran a check using disk doctor
it was pretty cool coz i used it via wallys disk doctor installed on his powerbook through firewire
i couldnt start up the disk doc using the cd so had to use my ibook as firewire disk and scan my hd on wallys powerbook
it was so cool we connected the firewire cable pressed t as my ibook started up and voila my ibooks contents appeared on wallys desktop woohoo macs rule anyways went to the other apple centre today
the it guy there was really nice
i explained what happened and mention the ahem small knock it had
told him my dilemma of warranty running out as well as the countless assignments due
he said no prob hell register my problem so when i go see him again when i can in a few weeks time after essays are done the warranty would still cover it
excellent so now i have time to do my assignments and also try reinstalling word for os x again to see if that could fix the problem
am doing work on word for os 9 right now btw
for nonmaccers with the new platform my ibook has 2 operating systems os x and os 9
2 can start up in os x via classic mode which is what im doing now with word
capeesh the it guy was pretty cool
hes like one of those dude it guys lah streaked blonde hair etc
and he kept saying no dramas meaning no problem
so now its charles who was also there to collect his new os x software and my catchphrase no dramas haha
got a poster as well from the place
its the imac but the old one lah not the new one
am planning to pop by other apple stores to see if they have other posters that are just stocking up
it hasnt been a good day
firstly i went to the apple store in town and they tell me the problem is probably the software and the warranty doesnt cover software only hardware
then they tell me if i want them to check it out itll cost a 90 diagnostic fee and then theyll give me a quote if i wanna repair the software
if it is a hardware problem then its covered under warranty
the whole process will take 34 days or did she say itll be 34 days b4 they get a look at it which means itll take at least 10 days altogether i dont have norton utilities or disk doctor either
it could very well be a software problem that can be fixed by reinstalling my ms word for os x or even reinstalling os x itself
but i dont have the ms office cd right now its with a friend
thing is my warranty runs out in 6 days
so if i wanna get it fixed i gotta do it quick
but i dont have the time to send it in coz i really need to finish researching and writing my essays argh
basically i just want it done in the quickest way less stress no spent
everything costs so much in australia im gonna try another apple store near my place tomorrow and see what they say
ill call ahead though and ask how much they charge for diagnostic fees etc
the place i went to today didnt even take a look at my mac i think its horribly unfair that they charge to tell you whats wrong with it
i can understand charging to fix the problem but not for taking a look at it previously they had fixed a problem i had with the ibook on the spot it wouldnt start up
today they werent even helpful i dont get it
why dont i ever learn
aaarrrggghhhhhhhhgggghhhhhh i dropped my ibook
ack now my microsoft word application wont open and certain folders in the finder cant be opened either
and i have 3 major essays due soon
help im almost in tears
and i really wanted to finish an essay by today so i could start on the rest
but i guess its not meant to be
the scary thing is i think i may have to send it into the apple store and get it fixed and they might wanna change the hard drive or something
which means ill have to backup all my applications etc
and i dont have a cd writer or anything although i could back it up on idisk on the apple servers but thatll take too long on my 56k modem
i think hopefully my ahem good buddy charles nudge nudge might lend me his external cdwriter so i can back up my stuff
why must this happen now im sure there must be a reason for all this to happen some sort of big master plan or something
either that or i should just be less lunzun
personally i think its the latter
not that i dont believe in a bmp just that im always lunzun charles and egene tell me that all the time
like how if i could just be more aware and watch what im doing i could avoid lotsa accidents
but the point is its not like im not trying or anything
when youre unconsciously unaware you just are
its not like you can really help it
or can you i dont know
as a famous man once said so help me god
someone please help me i cant seem to see my flooble on my mac
why my page views fine on pcs
just not on my ibook
i have given up given up on writing my essay so i just had kfc for dinner im gonna watch a dvd now woopeedoo as you can tell im learning and testing html as i go along
picking up bits n pieces along the way
but im still pretty new at it
thats why its an obsession now to tweak my blog
ive spent the whole day bumming around
havent written much only about 78 outta 2000 wds argh whats wrong with me i should really get off the net and get cracking
im supposed to be doing my essay now but am obsessed with fiddling with my blogs appearance
picking up a lil html along the way never done so b4
the only prob is i cant seem to change the colours on the side bar for shawn egene and barts links to orange like charles n tessas
and i cant seem to see the flooble chatterbox a forum thingy anywhere on the page i think coz i use a mac and havent updated my javascript capability or something
id also like to enable a comments link to my posts
anyone has any idea how to do so btw g0ldfi5h
com is no longer in use although the page still exists lah the archives
although the ones i wanted like goldfish
went to the hoyts cinemas website and saw a contest they had for spiderman winner gets an original signed poster
so i entered the contest the question was if you could be a super hero what kind would you be and why i wrote i wanna be superessaygirl to save the world of uni students from the drudgery of writing essays on postmodernism and psychoanalytic theory with my actoplasmo eyeglasses id scan all textbooks and regurgitate information into 16pg times font size 12 scripts cool huh hehe wish shed really exist so shed handle my essays for me haha
well then things are starting to heat up for me now
feeling the pressure a bit
not sure what to do
plus i have to struggle with the various assignments and i keep procrastinating
i think thats one of my biggest faults
anyways am eating butter and sugar on bread right now the poor mans brekky hehe
but it really doesnt taste fantastic on sourdough bread
my advice is stick to plain ol white loti
i got my radio assignment back today
had overslept and missed class this morning the second time this week i was royally pissed that it happened really wanted to make the class and discussworkshop my ideas with people coz i was feeling a little lost
anyways saw my tutor just before her next class and got back my radio assignment which i did pretty ok in
my good buddy charles got his back too and im pretty upset on his behalf
i read his piece a little before he handed it in and i really dont think it deserved a p
at the very very least an h3 the grading system in melbourne uni is h1 then h2a h2b h3 pass fail
and according to him she sorta dissed his idea for the feature story too
he wanted to write on palms or rather personal digital assistants
can you believe that she hasnt heard of them then again im not surprised
apparently australia is about 5 years behind in the whole pda world like their auspug australian palm users group was just set up recently as compared to the thriving one in spore and the states which have been around for ages
oh wells so much for that
hes gonna try to reangle his story and pitch it again
hope she takes the bait as for me im planning to do my topic on naturopathy
like natural healing and all
but i think the storys been done before so im trying to take a fresh approach
i thought of pursuing the angle of people studying naturopathy and why they choose to do so etc
but i realise that its too narrow for a 2500wd piece
the most i can squeeze outta this angle is about 1500 wds and thats the max
so what to do then any ideas please let me know
see her again on monday to discuss
even though i dont really feel sleepy slept from about 610pm just now eeks
screwing up my whole system
but im supposed to wake up early and go for brekky at this place called fruits of passion
its got really good brekky but a lil expensive
pancakes yay nitey nite ttfn ta ta for now
myers is having a sale today and tomorrow only so i ended spending 88 on lingerie but i bought like 7 items so that was pretty worth it usually 80 bucks only gets you about 2 bras and 1 underwear
so yes am pretty happy
going crazy shopping i know
i spent 2 hrs there solely in the lingerie section while poor charles had to wander around the department store alone
but all this spending really means i have to get down n search for a job
praying for a good and fun one
anyways we had a nice night after all that shopping
came back to homebush my old apt
where wally egene and shawn still reside and cooked dinner then had our monday tv night
yay nothing like good food and good company friends and the telly heehee
tomorrow my friend joannes supposed to arrive from canberra for a visit
that should be fun im also supposed to watch i am sam tomorrow as well cant wait
by the way everyones vacating homebush on july 7
wallys moving to stay with a church friend shawns moving to jons place and therefore becoming my neighbour while egene may or may not be returning to spore for good
its like an end of an era or something
had good times here plus both michelles and kenneths places are in north melbourne
wells were having a going away party on thursday have the whole gang over to bid this place a fond farewell
getting late better sleep now
yep im back to blogging again
its been quiet mostly coz ive been tied up with assignments n essays n stuff
but its the hols now at least till 29 july been having fun since stuff ended on the 14th
buller with egenes family and that was really fun
his whole family was there including his sis and broinlaw and nephew
boy the babys cute his names ethan and if i knew how to upload a pic onto my blog i would but sadly
need to find erm some server or something b4 i can upload pics right hmm
i think i can put it up on my mac site
anyways skiing was really fun had a ball of a time just tumbling down the slopes hehe
would have loved to ski more or at least try a longer distance but it wouldnt have been much fun without egene around
he couldnt ski coz he didnt want to risk injuring his knee again
watched the englandbrazil match at a pub yesterdat afternoon the telecast here was at 4
the crowd was a good mix of brazilian and english fans so there was an equal amount of cheering going on
we had originally intended to go down to a pub in the city but my friend who got there first said it was so packed they were turning people away
so we went to a place on the outskirts of the city instead
the match was pretty exciting
let it be known im not exactly a huge crazed fan of soccer but i do enjoy watching the game now and then especially between good teams
but i think i still prefer watching it by myself or with a smaller group of people
i guess when you dont share as much passion about the team as the vbdrinking bloke next to you its hard to cheer the team on and in the process slosh beer on your clothes
but there were these calm collected group of girls at the next table too watching the game having chips and wedges and the occasional lemon ruski
they looked as out of place as i did me with my calm claps plastic smile and feeling torn between rooting for england which my friends were and im supposed to by default as egene is a liverpool fan
and brazil which i kinda liked for their playing skills
plus brazil seemed like the underdogs in the beginning after owens goal
and ashley cole wasnt too friendly to ronaldinho whod placed his hand on the formers shoulder as a friendly gesture or what i perceived as a friendly gesture at least only to have cole shove his arm away
plus cole was equally rude to other players later on
erm if anyone disagrees drop a flooble and we can discuss the finer points of soccer etiquette which was why my heart kinda tugged towards the brazilian players after a while
well two bacardi breezers and many contraband hot peanuts we bought some from the asian grocer and snuck them in later brazils in the semis for the world cup
no surprises there i guess although it wouldve been nice to see england in the semis after all this time
i actually sound like i know my soccer stuff huh amazing
oh wells anyways it being the hols and all im trying to find a job now
either at a cafe or as a sandwich hand or something
both seem pretty fun to me
less boring than an office job
but i need a good environment pple and boss must be nice good flexible hours so i can still enjoy the hols and spend time with my sis when she comes over and good pay not too worried about that pay here is pretty decent from 1015 at least depending on the job
all rights almost 1am now am planning to go to church tomorrow after a looooong hiatus
bad huh so gotta go sleep nites okies its late
will write more hopefully tomorrow
drop me a flooble yah
something wrong with blogger is somthing wrong coz ive fiddled around with the blog but it seems kooky
like i actually added a counter but it keeps disappearing
and i also added some new links and that disappeared everytime i refreshed the template menu in the edit blog mode of blogger too
something fishys going on around here in my goldfish bowl
finished 2 essays the major ones at least
phew now only 2 to go
ive actually done the intercultural one the monsoon wedding review
now its just a matter of completing the feminist film one
freedom of speech i chanced upon this blog as how web surfing usually goes by clicking link to link to link
its a page about this lady in the states who got fired for what she wrote on her blog
whats the state of freedom of speech now internet laws are still in their infancy stage can she sue them for firing her joy any comments it makes me wonder could i get into trouble for what im posting right now if thats the case my blogll never be able to fully express what i think or feel coz gulp big brothers watching
this sucks doesnt it anyways i read what she wrote about her boss and coworkers
it seemed innocent enough a standard rageagainstthemachine rant
imho some people are just wayyyyyyyy too sensitive
i mean cmon its not like the whole world gets along right we all need room to express our pentup pissedoffness
the sad thing is i think the machine won
com has been abandoned although you can still read the archives
and this all happened in the good ol us of a where the the 1st amendment clearly states congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
the first amendment to the u
constitution of course this means that the government cant interfere
but it seems like nosy coworkers can
no big deal right singaporeans have always practiced selfcensorship right but at what price drop me a flooble yah
what in the world hmm
i took this test today off my sis blog
im a take the what high school stereotype are you quiz by angel
now thats a weird result
coz ive never thought myself as particularly athletic or er
then again if the bumbly butterfingered buffoon strikes again
read the 305 blog doli incapax and the 50egg cake to find out what happened in a previous episode
and yes tess ive gone jewish
ya talk sommor and i shvitz ya in ya tuckas ya hear thats my yiddishqueens accent courtesy of the nanny you know i actually remember the lyrics for the entire theme song to the show
erm minus a few gaps of course
she was selling some makeup in flushing queens when her boyfriend kicked her out in one of those crushing scenes
what was she to do where was she to go she was out on her fanny
so she over to the sheffields door she was selling some makeup the father saw more she had style she had flair she was there thats how she became the nanny
who would have thought that this girl we described would just exactly be what the doctor prescribed now the father found her beguiling watch out c

okies back to my essays
see ya sooon hmm i suddenly have the urge to pee
we interrupt our regularly scheduled programme to bring you this groundbreaking news story this morning at 2
30 am miss sarah wong a 22 yearold woman was admitted to the royal melbourne hospital after having an allergic reaction to the antiflatulence medicine mylanta
the allergy symptom is described as a red rash covering the length of the patients body with small bumps appearing on her arms and a little on her face and neck
the patient also suffered from puffy eyes and a cough resulting from the constriction of her windpipes making it hard for her to breathe
according to the woman described by nightshift nurses at the triage station as a walking asthmatic lobster with bumps she had overate during dinner and thus felt its residual effects a little heartburn and wind in the stomach
she then decided to take mylanta to help ease her discomfort
unfortunately 10 minutes after ingesting the medicine she felt flushed and experienced an itching sensation all over her body which gradually turned into a bumpy rash on her arms and neck
this was when she decided to call her boyfriend who drove her to a nearby hospital to receive treatment
according to miss wong my throat felt tight probably from the allergy as well which was why i thought it might be serious
i mean ive never been allergic to anything in my life before so i was quite worried
after a thorough examination by the doctor it was pronounced that the mylanta medicine was probably the cause of the reaction and not as suspected the garlic prawns she had consumed for dinner earlier that night
ive had mylanta once before but didnt have a reaction then though i was probably still allergic to it
apparently the first time i took it my body was just sensitised to it which explains why i didnt get a rash then
but this time round my body just reacted against it
after a dose of antehestamines injected into her system via a drip a painful firsttime experience as well and a few hours of sleep under observation the symptoms receded and the patient was free to go home with instructions to visit the allergy clinic the following week
im quite thankful that nothing more serious had happened i hear you can actually die from allergic reactions praise god im fine now ill probably be more careful with what i consume from now on and will make a habit of reading the labels in detail checking the ingredients list
i mean what if i end up turning into a yellow banana with fairy wings the next time round what happens then 30 july 2002 we now return you to our regulary scheduled programme
chest pains part deaux why do i seem to always hurt the ones i love the most why do i lash out sometimes i just wish that theyd disappear
even when i dont want them to
sometimes i just want to yell and scream and shout at people
to just fully release but i cant
i worry about consequences and their feelings and remorse that i know ill feel at the end
i wish they wouldnt take it personally if i really did that
even if it really is personal
if i could have said something just now i would have said actually i dont know what i would have said
my hearts beating way too fast for its own good now
it hurts to have the blood and vessels pump at such a rate
chest pains my heart is thumping really quickly now
way too quickly for any good
heartburn must be the garlic prawns
i miss my sister terribly it just seems strange not to have her hanging around irritating me just joking
even though it was only for a week she really made her presence felt and i mean that in a good way
just doing the scrapbook for our trtip to tasmania brings fond memories of a time past recently last week in fact
maybe its just the thought that i wont see her for quite a while with her going to bristol in septoct and all
she represented on a deeper level a link to my family back home
oh how i miss them all
tomorrow is the start of a new term
how did the holidays fly by so quickly i can honestly say it has been an eventful break what with all the travelling ive done and the things ive seen
still no luck with the job hunt though
favour lord favour theres still so much to do and see
this semester promises to be a challenging one with me taking two film subjects equating to two 3000 word essays in the middle of the semester hopefully holding fort with a job and i havent gotten round to taking those driving lessons ive been saving up for and which money i have technically spent already on ordinary expenses
im also planning to help out with the childrens ministry in church and am also taking an alpha course which is sorta a foundation studies thing good coz its like going back to the basics of the bible
wow so many things to accomplish grace needed here well shawns back which means i see even less of eg coz his comp
and best bud are both at jons place shawns jons new roomie
everyone always kids that the 2 of em are like lovers erm eg and shawn not eg and his comp
although now that i think about it the pc always seems to hum a little when egs around
anyways the point is in this little love triangle im the concubine you see
unless you go by egs version which is that im the wife the one hes married to while shawns the mistress the one who he really wants to be with
no lah its good that he hangs out with his buddy gives me a lil space a lil of my time you know so however much i whine that ill never see as much of eg now that shawns back im pretty ok about it plus im glad shawnies back too
miss his sudden rants about societys faults and the various places in melbourne which are a bloody ripoff welcome back shawn
yet another one yep this confirms it
im a womyyyyyn no need for no man grrrrrl power
quizzes here are a couple i took recently

medusahair skinny body waaaay too much makeup
now this i can identify with
menlittle miss are you take the quiz find out quiz made by jadeddazey hehehehe
chaddy and dandenongnongnenong i had a truly wonderful time today
woke up went shopping in chadstone shopping mall with my sis and then drove to mt
dandenong where i had terrific devonshire scones the hugest sundae youve ever seen and lovely asparagus chicken and cheese fingers accompanied by taylors tea
not by myself of course with egene tess and charles
later it was time spent wondering around looking at nice tea shops and bought essential oils and an oil burner which unfortunately i cracked much later that night
no fear its still usable one of those internal cracks caused by sudden change in temperatures when i ran some water over the hot dish
added to the depletion in my wallets funds was the spent on a nice new 3forthepriceof2 book at borders which turned out to have a 20 discount for uni students today
charles and eg returned at night to make more purchases
and that was my day
tomorrow should be fun as well prepping for a bday party for my sis who turns 19 and wholl be insisting on wearing the pretty fairy wings she bought today
itll be a mediumsmall affair about 10 pple for a potluck dinner
little cocktail sausage hors douevers anyone but tomorrow also marks the 2nd last day ill see my sis for a really long while
shell be in bristol from septemberoctober onwards for the next 3 years
but shell be back at least once a year so thatll be good
am planning to visit her in bristol one day so we can get a euro rail pass and travel round europle
excitement having tessa around made me realise a lotta things about myself somehow
in many ways were so much alike bumbling making mistakes as we find our way through life and its hard when i realise stuff she does that irritate me probably irritate others when i do it too
plus i also seem to nag a lot at her hehe
which incidentally is very much the same way eg used to nag at me
as she puts it i tend to treat her like a living doll often mothering even smothering her
i guess coz im too used to being the older sis
am trying to let go i guess
one things for sure though im definitely going to be bawling when she leaves on friday
i can imagine it now me blubbering away at the airport
really for all the stuff that irritates me when shes here like not having my own space small quibbles about inane stuff i really love having my sister around
especially coz we both share the same warped sense of humour were the only 2 idiots who laugh at each others halfassed jokes which would usually elicit a loud groan and shake of the head from other people
underneath certain differences we get each other
plus its also cool when we can trick other people over the phone coz we both sound the same
ah well mushy eh ahhh i can still recall the times when wed fight and scratch and pull each others hair
conversations with my sis tess namu me er
namu tess namunamunamu me you have namuitis
tess shock horror namu is not a disease its a way of life note to readers i still have absolutely no idea what namu is
a term purportedly invented by my sis it still dares to do the unthinkable and defy definition
one up for the thinkoutoftheboxers
tess and tas in the last few weeks i can safely say i was never for a moment bored
spent last wed to sun morning in tasmania with charles egene and my sis tessa
it was a fantastic getaway seeing the sights and generally spending a wonderful time with my sis
really enjoyed it i should put up some photos
schools starting next week though which is kinda a drag where did all the good times go plus im still on the hunt for a job which i cant seem to get unless i confirm my timetable
well well see what happens
this semester promises to be pretty exhausting
on another note mac is gonna start charging me to use the email account and all the other nifty features it has like idisk and homepage
i dont use much of it i guess mostly just the email account which is forwarded from my school account anyways
its just coz theres the benefit of having a pop or imap account which means i can dl me mails
darn really dun wanna pay the for it its us99
95 a year but i get a discount for the first year so its 49
but its still in us dollars
going to chadstone the largest shopping mall in the southern hemisphere and mt
this cool english tea place that features u guessed it agatha christies ms marples character as its central character
am trying to revamp my blog somewhat add in cool stuff like piccies and i dunno interesting stuff i guess
good that tess is around so she can help me
i woke up today with the intention of arriving at 9am in school to help the newbies with enrolment
guess what time i arrived 10
woohoo that has gotta be a record
in the end they didnt really need much help so i just mooshed around chatting gossiping discussing last nights satc and buffy episodes btw the 2 ep
finale was on tonight willow vs buffy
to the uninformed tara willows gf got shot accidentally and willows on this killtheworldsoifeelbetterbutenduphurtingmyselfandthepeopleilove rampage
not that im really a fan actually
i just watch it once in awhile when i happen to flip the channel
demons and witches pardon me for my lack of liberalminded thinking still pretty much freak me out
they might seem harmless on tv with their wisecracks and all but thats what the devil wants you to think doesnt he hmmm
wondering if i should bother to sign up for the melbourne blog meetup or not
the name game i like the name aidan aydun
guess it must be all that sex and the city that ive been watching
it just has a nice ring to it doesnt it i also like the name arian or arienne or whatever spelling permutations there are
nice name for kids dont you think i can imagine yelling at them to tell em dinners ready
ahhh riiiiii or danny sounds nice eh although i also would like calling my kid by hisher initials too which is why a middle name is needed
like cj or aj or kc or something
i once thought of calling my daughter caitlin josephine just so i could shorten it to cj
egene sadly thought naming his kid aidan samuel soh wouldve been a laugh yeah we both like the name aidan
whoever gets a boy first gets that name dammit
can you imagine the teasing and bullying the poor child would face in the playground who wants his kids initals to be ass wah lau eh
ah wells who gets the male mind eh
its one of those days its one of those days when you just hate everything and everyone and everything around you
i dont understand why im so edgy
and its annoying that it just comes out in tightlipped strained tones when i speak
i apologise to anyone who had to cross my path today
i hate that i cant express myself properly fully and without whining
as one of my good friends michelle says sarah and whining just go together but we accept it i suppose
sometimes i just wanna lash out and yell words that would make a hardcore sailor blush
drew drew a picture of drool
yeppers this week is drew barrymore week
with highlights on tv wed and sat best men and home fries plus me n eg are watching riding in cars with boys tonight
my friend elaine is flying off tomorrow morning to see her bf in san fran
hes a sailor she met at the wtc in singapore
i hope she takes lots of pictures anyways gtg watch ricwb now
coffee tea or me thaaaaaaats right
im becomin a ahem barista or in more colloquail terms kafei mei
yep just applied at the coffee bean and tea leaf round the corner from my place and hopefully will get a job there serving people their cappucinos and cafe lattes
need money to supplement my expensive habits like shopping eating and taking public transport
youd be amazed at how much i spend a week
not to mention groceries rent and phone bills
but being a kafei mei isnt too bad an idea
i dont really mind it actually mostly coz the hours are flexible you get to interact with people and you arent stuck behind a desk and computer
its fun actually which is why im pretty excited about it if i get the job
the funny thing about melbourne is to get any job youve gotta have a resume
even for parttime work at coffee joints
strange huh back home they just make you fill up a form and if you look pleasant enough speak good english and can tell the difference between a mocha iceblended and a mocha caramel iceblended its the caramel duuhhh youre a shooin for the job
here they get you to fill in a form and a resume with references mind you people they can call to vouch for you just in case youre a schizophrenic psychopath about to suddenly attack customers with scalding hot special dutch chocolate
can you just imagine that sttstttsttt
must get foam just right stttststttt just right caramel mocha mocha
did she just give me five cents less hey lady youre five cents short
its four ninetyfive lady fiver at the end lady heard that says so on the screen five cents lady five cents geddit fiiiiivvveee cents fiiiiivvvvvee whole cents what you dont know how to count huh ahhhhhhhhh and i suddenly launch at the poor unsuspecting woman desperately trying to dig out the coin from her purse with trembling fingers screaming like a banshee spilling caramel and creamy milk everywhere a bulbous vein throbbing at my temple
phew erm in case my future employers are somehow reading this im not really insane
ive never been institutionalised at a mental hospital before unless you count my secondary school years
just needed to clear that up
well the jobs all in gods hands
praying for it and going by faith
i really want a job that has a good working environment good colleagues and boss good flexible hours and good pay its pretty standard pay here the beanll prob
pay me about 1012 an hour a rate ill never get back in spore
hourswise i wrote on my application form that id prefer the morning 7am12pm slots tues to fridays although negotiable simply coz that frees up the rest of the day and my sis is coming to visit
and i dont really have to wake up that early coz i live pretty near
so praying theyll probably call me soon to arrange an interview
ill sell the fact that i can spell most peoples names an asset when writing them down on the plastic iceblended cups
can you imagine the bean at junction 8 bishan spelt my name as seyla wah lau eh
drop me a flooble yah
daisies and daffodils oh yesterday was wonderful
helped out with daffodil day which is basically a day the cancer council of victoria has to raise funds for cancer research
it was really fun woke up at 6 plus am can u believe it and im not a morning person
went down to flinders st
station and sold all sorts of daffodiltype merchandise including pins ribbons pens a cute teddy bear which was dressed for summer complete with thongs on his paws a footy ball and bunches of real daffodils i got to wear this daffodil day tshirt which i even managed to keep though i really wanted to keep this yellow pouch we used to collect money in but couldnt
so there we were a bunch of girls at a table outside the station selling stuff
3 of us decided to wander down a lil further outside maccers on swanston st
and managed to sell quite a bit too
we even got our picture taken by this passing photog
all in all a really fun start for yesterday
id definitely do it again esp
since it was for a good cause or as ew lee puts it buy a daffodil support a chawitab
ahfeggetit its for cancer research and people do make an effort and come up and support the cause
best of all hello yellow is so my colour
the big issue i saw him at flinders street station today
got off the tram and bought a copy
at least i think it was him
maybe he was just another gruff old man
i hope it was him
no time to look for one either
why i dont have a regular job any longer
they told me yesterday after my shift that they were implementing a change in the schedule or something and would call me as and when they needed me
so now its a casual basis kinda thing
they were pretty vague about a reason why this had to happen and i was still under shock so i didnt press for details
i figured maybe coz they had 2 new pple this shanghainese woman and man who seemed like new partners or soemthing
i honestly think its a cheap way of firing someone and letting them down nicely yet keeping them hanging on your lil pinky finger so you can depend on a filler when you need someone
i mean what the after 2 weeks of training etc
and i really think i did pretty ok and got along with everyone
if it was just a trial tell me it was a trial
i shifted my classes around so i could fit the job in
i have a bleedin 4 hour break on wednesdays for goodness sake id better cancel the scheduled transfer thats supposed to move every week from my bank account to a savings maximiser one
was planning to put aside each week earn interest and have at the end of the semester to fly back home for hols
happened to my friend who was working the mon thurs shift too
on the upside at least im using the time to get some research done
am not daring to try mylanta again
tried 3 other forms of medication though to no effect
only looking forward to the presentation for tv cultures weve been working at
were gonna majorly impress the pple and whoop everyones ass as michalengelo of the teenage mutant ninja turtles would say cowabunga duuude
regret ever had one of those moments where you coulda shoulda woulda done something if you werent frozen by nervousness or inertia one of those moments where you miss an opportunity and it never really quite comes round again today one of the vendors for the big issue came up the tram
he was a wellbuilt old man his face tan and leathery his hair silver and each of the many wrinkles on his gruff visage told of the things he had seen and done
he stood tall proud save for a scruffy grey sweater that had seen better days and a big issue vest and sling bag both worn at the edges
he sat on the seat in front of me facing the lady on my left
i stole a quick peek at the cover a smiling rachel griffiths next to a headline for six feet under
i averted my eyes i didnt feel like buying a copy
true the money went to a good cause the magazine employed the homeless to raise funds for the homeless helping them get back on their feet
but except for the 5 copies i bought last year when the idea of giving back to society in such a convenient way was still a novel idea i hadnt approached a vendor to buy one since i didnt have time to read anyway
are you a rachel griffiths fan young lady said the old man to a ponytailed woman whod just come up the tram
she just smiled and shook her head
you know why im asking dont you he pressed on the magazine in his hand a wry smile on his lips
she smiled and nodded then turned away
yeah not much of a fan myself just like the photographs he said smiling to himself as he twisted the magazine in his hand
are you a rachel griffiths fan he asked the bespectacled teenage boy that came up next
are you a rachel griffiths fan he asked the lady sitting across the aisle
she shook her head too absorbed in her own thoughts
are you a rachel griffiths fan he asked the lady next to me
i looked down at my shoes then stared straight ahead
he didnt bother asking me
he got off the tram at the next stop
my heart was pounding my head was screaming
i should have done something
i could have bought a copy
hed just fallen on tough times
he could be someones father someones grandfather
he could have saved lives
i could have invited him back for a cuppa we could have talked
we would both have made a new friend
i looked out the window and saw him cross the road to flinders street station
he stood outside in the cold wrapped in his grey sweater holding the big issue smoking a cigarette
i opened my bag and saw my wallet
i took it out looked through saw that i had a tendollar bill and a fivedollar one
i could have bought a copy
yep sorry havent been on for awhile mostly coz v
bz with school and all
subjects this sem are tv cultures expert on this marcomm although unlike the one i took in mass comm
more theoretical italian national cinema must read up on fascism etc etc
and contemporary hollywood cinema can someone please explain 2001 a space odyssey to me please special mention alert welcome priyanca yes this is my blog
however if you are reading this right now get back to work
i wonder what aware would think of their brightest young talent if they found out she was spending time reading peoples blogs instead of doing her job
tired nowadays mostly coz of the early starts
am not a morning person and i hate having 9 am classes
and i have another tomorrow the job so far is pretty cool
getting to know the people at work a lil better and jahmes seems to be loosening up
hes actually a pretty nice guy
i guess one of the perks of the job are the free coffee and food
i mean the last place i worked at was so anal about making money it charged its employees if they wanted to eat the food there while they were working i mean i can understand if any day you just happened to pop by and ordered something youd have to pay but i mean come on if youve been working there 4 hours in a row and theres no lunch break and if you wanna grab something to munch on while there werent customers you still have to pay so much for employee benefits
phew i hoped all that made sense
whatever it is i like how the jobs going so far
have decided to take one of the church aunties advice and put aside a lil each week after tithing of course as part of a savings plan
theres this fundinvestment management firm where i can transfer from my bank account earn interest through them and transfer the back anytime i want
its pretty good and the current rate is 4
75 on yr principal calculated daily with no other charges and no minimal principal amount
sounds pretty good eh hopefully can save enough to go for a lil holiday back home to spore at the end of the year
here are some things i must do and soon
stop munching on those addictive arnotts mint slices 2
reduce chockie intake just now the house thats evelyn me eg shawn chris and jon who wasnt around coz he was out took a stock take and realised that all my snacks had choc
content even the healthy muesli bars
start exercising which may be hard coz i cant make the taibox classes this sem and my ankles acting up
btw havent even started using my new running gear eek
oh yes on this note just caught a really freaky episode of smallville this clark kentinhighschool drama
a prettybutplump arent we all girl was desperate to lose weight so she started drinking veggie shakes made out of veggies found in her garden
thing is some meteors from krypton had landed there when clark aka superman landed on earth and so the veggies were genetically altered somehow
everytime she drank them her fat content reduced dramatically liposuction wo the tubes so she became slim pretty fast woohoo
but after awhile she started getting really hungry and the only way she could successfully stave off the hunger was by consuming another beings fat like a deer and this mean guy that used to bully her
hows that for revenge creeeppy
come one come all meet the the incredible shrinking girl who sucks up your fat eeeek
start on essay research which eek are all due in five weeks time one of the classes is tv cultures and have been doing tonnes of research for it heheh watching the tube that is
finally change the shpiel of the week and now off to bed
zzzzz drop me a flooble or sign my guestbook
a new dawn awaits all right i have a new job up and its starting tomorrow excitment its just a simple cafe job and im not sure what my duties exactly are but its in school and its income so ill try my best
really need favour in the managers eyes phew getting this job was such an ordeal mostly becasue ive never received any replies to the resumes i sent out over the hols
but maybe its good coz mebbe god wanted me to hold out for this esp
since in school and i got to fully devote my time in the hols to doing mestuff and hang out with my sis
well the cafe is run by these shanghainese
i have no either what posessed me to do so but i spoke to them in mandarin argh my halfpast six broken chinese
it all started innocently enough
i went down to the cafe dropped off the cv spoke to the manager in english he in his chineseaccented english too
the following week i got a missed call from them so i called back
the guy i spoke to who wasnt the manager though started speaking to me in mandarin so thats how it all started
i went down the next day with my timetable and spoke to the manager in mandarin thinking after all hey i handled a whole conversation yesterday in the language i can do this too
the manager seemed a little surprised at my speaking mandarin though
whatever it was i was really proud of the fact i asked for his name before i left in the polite mandarin form oh dui bu qi qing wen ning gui xing oh excuse me by the way may i know your name to which he replied oh jahmes teeheeheee
yeppers jahmes teeheeeheee he called later that week woke me up on a friday morning asking me in mandarin of course if i could start work the following week
yes i was really happy praise god thing is that early in the morning 11 a
mind you i mean who wakes up at such an ungodly hour i couldnt form the proper words to reply in mandarin
so you can imagine how the conversation went qing wen ze shi huang xiao jie shi ma pardon me is this miss wong ahh
shi shi yes yes wo shi chong xxx cafe da lai de
im calling from xxx cafe
oh dui dui dui oh yes yes yes oh dui dui dui
was he making fun of me qing wen ni zhao dao gong zuo le ma oh yes yes yes
may i ask if youve found a job yet oh hai mei you
i was really struggling with it
he was asking me if i could shift my subjects around so i could work on tuedays and wednesdays
i just simply couldnt articulate properly what i wanted to say and had to repeat myself a couple of times peppering my broken mandarin with a smattering of english words like timetable etc
finally after everything was settled i was about to say bye when he said ni de hua yu jiang de bu tai hao hor your mandarin really isnt very good is it said as more of a statement than a question i was stunned to say the least
so i just said the only thing that popped into my head
hah hah wo shuo ni de hua yu jiang de bu tai hao hor i said your mandarin isnt very good is it oh dui er nah shi ying wei er ying wen shi wo di yi ge er language
oh yes er that is because er english is my first er language
nah ni jiu jiang ying wen ba

oh yes yes i mean i really didnt know what to say

no rave reviews and recitations have been met by either puzzled looks or blank expressions

heres another silly song with sarah the brinjal song aka an ode to egene youre a purple brinjal you like to dance and sing when you shake your brinjal butt it makes a sound that goes ding ding ok ok i know why is eg a brinjal just thought he looks like one lah
btw do you know the other names for brinjal are aubergine and eggplant teeheehee
that said i dont really like eating it unless its the lasagneversion that wally taught me to make
very very yummy brinjallasagne recipe 1
fry brinjal till translucent like how you would an onion i guess 2
on baking tray lined with baking paper place a layer of fried brinjal 3
pour spoonfuls of spaghetti sauce on top of the brinjal 4
repeat with additional layers of brinjals and sauce until desired height 5
top off with a sprinkling of cheese parmesan mozzie tasty chedder swiss whatever you like 6
bake in oven till cheese has melted i usually put it at a really high temperature so i dont have to wait too long
but that means you gotta watch it so it doesnt burn voila yummy brinjallasagne
i spent a very enjoyable weekend so far
friday was spent at the dfo near moorabin airport with lotsa nice cheap stuff to buy
got a pair of just jeans for 39
95 and eg bought me a pair of slippers for 12
and i got sidetracked by a 12
95 top which i was totally indecisive about and i didnt buy in the end
was too conscious that id eventually decide it wasnt flattering after i bought it and wouldnt wear it in the end
yesterday was a great day spent with some church friends a bunch i got closer to through the alpha course we take in church
we had yum cha then watched the bourne identity featuring many outoffocus shots then watched a lil footy it was the grand final after all the brisbane lions beat the collingwood magpies 7566 on the big screen at crown casino while our friends played a lil rapid roulette hehe
i think it was pretty great when we came back and hung around playing cards and a lil twister
all in all a very enjoyable day spent with them
i know how ive totally not really felt comfortable at accf primarily because of the lack of a group of pple to hang out with mostly coz they were aussieasian so there was a huge difference when we talked even for simple slang terms and the wavelength
but this bunch is pretty cool mostly malaysians but still got the lors and the lahs hehe
its a great funny bunch of people funny as in we laugh a lot
last night me eg and shawn and evie for a lil while played upwords

jazz and the charleston oooh
went to watch the cats meow starring kirsten dunst cary elwes and also edward hermann rorys grandad in gilmore girls who plays william randolph hearst the 1920s newspaper titan
quick trivia did you know that citizen kane was supposedly based on his life hearst i mean not hermann
the cats meow is based on the novel written by elinor glyn about what really happened on a yachting trip in 1924
actually 15 november 1924 to be exact hehe my birthdate ooooooooh
movie and the webstie have really nice 1920sstyle songs
its actually playing in the bg as i type
and the charleston dances they did seemed pretty funky too hehe
am plannign to watch lilo n stitch later prob at highpoint
some lighthearted toon eh to jazz up the week
man ive really been watching lotsa movies these couple of days
prob to make up for the months of abstinence hehe
and please remember floobles down so leave a bl00p comment lah
i have returned from watching goldmember
dunno why didnt laugh as much as i thought i would
maybe my expectations were a little high i know i know
how do u have high expectations when u watch austin powers right but no i actually like watching shall we say doctor evilstyle finger quotes stupid movies
like american pie road trip although tom green was trey gross and the list goes on
overall i think the best part of the show was the cameos in the beginning and the westside story song n dance sequence
pretty nifty legwork i would say
beyonce knowles had great abs bland acting no sparkles there
the highlight was doing the typical singaporean thing after the movie supper except it was more like dinner coz we hadnt eaten
we took our first trip to bismi a regular prata shop in melbourne with yummy prata and teh tarik and it was pretty cheap too
full meal 2 pratas n tarik for only 4
my sis is leaving for bristol tomorrow night
just reading her blog makes me sad in away like shell be so much further away its not just a 23hr time difference anymore depending on daylight savings but much much more the other end of the world i will really miss her
somehow i feel and wish i could be a better sis n i dunno
be able to give her greater emotional support
one of those churchtype people who she referred to in her blog who dont really know what to say and give triedntrue advise coz i probably dont understand the emotional turmoils she goes through
im less angsty i guess
the 2 of us are quite different in many ways even since we were young
she tended to rebel and question the system and still does which im very proud of actually she doesnt just accept things as they are unlike me while i just happily went about my way
sure wed fight all the time thought hated each other when we were kids and i really thought she was a pest when i was in secondary school i remember once when i went back to get my olevel results n she popped by to find out how i did she was in sec 1 then and i was like why you come
aiyah just go back to your class lah
i guess i really hurt her then
and even when she started hanging round my friends like the old awake friends and the tsunamit people i guess i didnt like her infringing on my territory
irony is shes prob closer to them now than i ever was
i think one thing that stands out vividly in my mind when we were kids was that she always had a flair for the dramatic
on a trip to china she stood at the front of the bus in her little white jumpsuit and rainbowcoloured checked shirt and sang into the mike connected to the bus audioo system while everyone clapped and cheered along
wah lau eh attention seeker haha
but there was a really sweet side to her too
we had had a fight or a brawl should i say what with the pinching scratching hairpulling etc
i think i hit her too hard and she started crying and ran to my mum who took the cane out
i ran to the corner and was really prepared for a whacking man coz she really looked pissed
and then my sis ran in front of me spread her hands out and said no dont beat jie jie so sweet right in my head i was thinking wah lau eh trying to act again watch too much channel 8 serials
but at the same time still relieved coz my mums face softened
haha oh the stories of childhood
to tess if youre reading this b4 your flight tomorrow
take care god bless and youll do fine in bristol
i love you very very much
poke the penguin poke this cutie and find out what happens
yay oh happy happy sunshine song i have completed 3 of the essays due today and the 4ths due the day after the hols end

last night so wasnt supposed to take too long but ah wells
in the end finished at 4
30pm 500 extra words eep hope i dont get penalised rushed to get everything printed out reached school at 5

the last leg of my essay mash
trying to read all the stuff on domesticity for tv cultures essay except i did exactly what the readings said lotsa pple so with tv
watch it in the background
how intertextualpostmodern is that a reading of me reading my readings while participating in the reading of televisual forms
ever tried speed reading i did what i was taught eons ago in secondary school place a finger in the middle of the sentence and try to read the whole thing without moving yr eyeballs
theory is to encapsulate the sentence at a glance letting your mind fill in gaps in the sentence ie pick out key words
its not possible without incurring any serious injury
painful only try if youre already pah ciao i saw my tv cultures lecturer at the gelati place just now what a coinkidink sarahspeak for coincidence
dont think he recognised me though
which was just as well
yep theres been a spate of hilarious eccentricity going on in the wong household back in spore
to find out more please and i beg you to go to my sis blog coz this time round i literally choked with laughter on an arnotts mint slice no less while reading it
feminista ive recently come across this website called big bad chinese mama
its a really interesting website posing as an asian mail order bride service that serves to as the manifesto says catch men in the act of porning
i sent the websites url round to a couple of close friends little knowing the stir it caused
but it was a really good stir as in we started debating about the sites effectiveness at subverting patriarchal oppression whether its too controversial and nihilistic with the malebashing and all
this was what i wrote in my humble opinion i figure that our resident big bad mama is not simply ranting against the patrairchal standards of today
however much we can argue about gender equality about our roles in society about men and women walking hand in hand towards that great light of peace and harmony she is using humour as a way to deconstruct the ideologies of femininity today
ive personally used the same approach albiet in a less confrontational way to satirise the global female fashion industry in my project for class last year yes yes boast boast teeheehee its a pretty inyourface confrontational gesture i suppose
what i think is good about the site is that it stands to subvert current norms of thinking through parody
yeah were pretty much living in a posteverything world postfeminist postmodern yadayada
the fight has been fought the battle has been somewhat won but the war for equality still goes on wow how prosaic
like velle said the branches of feminsism stretch far and wide i think its all down to the whole personalaspolitical approach again i
if you feel that women and men play diff roles so be it
if you feel we should use whatever power we have sexual or otherwise to do whatever we can to climb to the top and change things from within so be it
personally im more of the humourworkstodeconstruct kinda thing
mostly coz a my kinda humour does not serve to uphold my pretty lotus blossom image yes i can hear the coughs in the background i know who you are and b i have a pretty wacked out sense or humour and damn im proud of it also i think the fact that were debating and thinking about it the website as well as feminism at large legitimises the topic anyways yay one up for the womyn another point i want to make is also this the fact is that the issues for women today lies not in debating about feminism or taking up the cause or whatever
when we discuss womens issues casually even with the same women who took my feminsit film n tv theory class last sem and i say that im a feminist its always greeted with a blank stare and oh so what do you do
everyone equates feminism with activism and the braburning butch stereotype
i think feminism today is more subversive and with the use of new technology unfortunately a world equated with the technogeeksareusuallymen idea thats what bigbadchinesemama
i mean i told my friend i use to clean my boyfriends bathroom for him and she said oh youre definitely not a feminist that way
i had to explain firstly i liked cleaning bathrooms coz it was cathartic for me in a weird way must be all the fumes ive been inhaling from the jif bottle and secondly he wasnt free to do it and we needed to get it sparkling for the real estate agents inspection and thirdly its nice to do something for someone man or woman
if she had asked me to clean her bathroom for her i would have if and only if it wasnt in too deplorable a shape
the defences we have to keep coming up with
friday the 13th of sept 2002
yep finished with my italian national cinema essay as well as marcomm
now its on to hollywood and tv cultures and ive only 1 week yipes quick number crunching thats about 4 days for each
including research for tv cultures reading and planning for the hollywood presentation on monday morning and writing both 1500 essays

then this lady at a shop he patronised said he looked realllll cute like a like a koala and then this ditty came to me just now while we were just standing round the kitchen and i was drinking my tea and he was washing the dishes
yep inspiration strikes everywhere 12 sept 2002
alpha and omega i just returned from alpha camp over the weekend and it was thoroughly enjoyable
it was pretty far from melbie though in upper plenty so far it was hardly on the melway map
but the place was so fantastic the dorm rooms the toilet all really neat and clean esp
all the amenities you needed great food plus a real fireplace
what more could you ask for we spent the 2d2n there enjoying each others company and learning more about the holy spirit part of the alpha course im taking at church sorta like a foundation backtobasics of christianity kind a thing
eg had a great time too
probably coz there was some serious male bonding going on
him and a bunch of other likeminded noisy guys sitting around after lunch talking about cars n stuff
i made my friend alan promise never to turn into them guys sitting around congratulating themselves on being the masters of the universe
he said no guarantees there
what happened to all the sensitive new age guys one highlight was learning mafia this really interesting game where someone gets killed and you gotta find out who did it
think murderer meets bluff meets survivor and you get the gist
3 mafiosi 1 doctor 1 spy and the rest are civilians 9 people in all plus 1 gamemaster
you should see the heated debates as everyone tried to defend themselves and prevent who they thought were compadres from being voted out
very layered game and you never know whos bluffing
very fun and also very interesting coz youve got this group of christians who are essentially lying to each other
hehe anyways it was a great experience and id definitely do it again if i had the chance
right now slogging n trying to keep up with the essay schedule
blog connection if there is just one thing you must do today please please read my sisters blog specifically the entry named dangerous dated 6sep02
there youll have a delightful insight to the inner workings of my neurotic family and finally truly understand why i am the way that i am
it all makes sense now as you all know ive been writing silly songs aptly named silly songs with sarah for awhile now
to the unenlightened silly songs are basically ditties that just pop into my head once in awhile outta blue totally offguard
they could be lyrics to wellknown songs a la weird al yankovic or just well songs with a tune
heres a sample to the tune of kylies i just cant get you outta my head i just cant get you outta my spleen boy oh boy do i need antifungal cream also to the tune of p
s alive i cant see at night for the very first time i believe i am blind so blind i cant drive past nine otherwise ill die but night blindness is fine so fine anyways i just came across in one of my readings a man named philip j
kitchen so now this ditty i came up with a year ago finally makes sense ahem kill kenny chicken
but dont kill the kitchen
repeat please dont ask me who kenny chicken is
just some figment of my subconcious i suppose
but now we do know how kitchens can be killed when theyre human heeheeheeteeheehee
previously dont kill the kitchen came with a with germs lah reply to peoples perplexed expressions
there of course have been times when these ditties have come back to bite me on the ass unintentionally of course no malicious content and all grated songs ok
i recorded one as my voicemail message and left it there for quite awhile
thing is a potential employer for this job i really wanted to try out for after i graduated but which i thought wouldnt come through coz he hadnt called for months since i put the application in finally gave me a tinkle on the phone and i didnt hear the phone
and he heard the song
and this was the message he left er wow
thats er real interesting er
anyways this is colin gomez from perfect 10
run forrest run i went for a run just now
sick of just moaning about me weight and fat and took action yay
my feet are killing me im slightly flatfooted so it really hurts when its pounding on the ground
the run wasnt too bad at all 1min jog 1 min walk
in other news just heard that sia might be resurrecting ansett the airline company gone bust here
in other other news am doing marcomm n my lecturer is a major slacker
cant be bothered to put the lecture notes up on the net which hes been promising to do so so i dont have access to the notes i missed
whatever it is am so positively swamped with work now
really need grace to get through this which is why i havent been bloggin much hehe
okies better get back to the daily grind
the day when many things happened lets start at the very beginning
a very good place to start
12 pm woke up feeling really shitty coz the night before i was all tense about my italian cinema take home exam question which i had no idea how to write coz it had to center around 2 specific topics from a list
one topic migration i could relate to the film looking for alibrandi but i had absolutely no clue which other to pick
so i just read my bible and it seemed specifically tailored for me talking about how we should rejoice in trials
to quote some movie i watched that which doesnt break us only makes us stronger
was it arnie i dont remember
so i decide to just pick one of the topics mezzogiorno and find out more about it coz a it was part of the weeks readings on post war politics which i could possibly link to alibrandi and migration and b coz i wanted to know what it actually meant in english
typed in a search in askjeeves and voila it basically refers to the south italy region encompassing sicily calabria etc
woopee italianaustralian immigrants always harken back to their homeland esp
sicily and it was done so in alibrandi
30 pm mobile phone rang and i ran to pick it up
the caller id said anonymous so it was from a private number
hello is this sarah yes it is
hi im mike from gloria jeans coffees i received your email early this morning
could you come in sometime for an interview in short im meeting mike whos wearing a black shirt tomorrow regarding a position as a baristacustomer service staff at a new store theyre opening on bourke street
i also applied for another job a call centre one answering questions on an upcoming govt
campaign but they havent got back to me
15 pm am still on the bleeding tram when i should be in class already
im giving a presentation for my italian cinema class 3
25 pm phew class hasnt started yet
55 pm presentation went ok
everyone was anxious to go to the pub rest of tute lesson pub
cool huh so they werent really listening
what to do its the last tute for the semester
anyways didnt join them on to the next presentation for tv cultures
00 pm well the multimedia festival went well though it ended late
everyones presentation was really good sadly ours didnt win a prize 4 prizes for 7 groups plus door prize draws
my honourable mentions go to the group that talked about phua chu kang and syntax and also the guy that did celeb impersonations of ozzy osbourne and bill cosby talking about global television
00 pm doors open for the john mayer concert yayyyyy 8
30 pm charlton hill an aussie group sporting a cute front man perform
the radio single twos company at least thats what i think the title is
45 pm jm comes on stage yay it was a fantastic concert and the crowd was good rocking and rolling along
i must say a lot for his musicianship hes pretty good at the guit
and his voice is great too
hes fabulous to see live too interacted with the crowd and all
overall nice preprock look he was wearing a shirt which was drenched by the end of the night
hehe we sneaked in an md player and recorded the entire thing although i talked at a couple of instances
hopefully my voice doesnt come out so the recording doesnt turn into john mayer in melbourne the karaoke version
charles read on his website that jms actually fine with pple recording his performances esp
since its a good form of promotion
as long as doesnt change hands
its fine to let your friends have a copy and all
now that i think is the right attitude to have
with all the hoohaa over piracy and music and downloading mp3s and all sometimes its nice to have an artiste not being so ngimjim over money
i mean the record companies are having hernias over the whole piracy issue mostly coz of the money they say theyre losing
get with the program not making as much as you thought you would does not qualify as a loss
most times they dont just break even they have lotsa profits
hello metallica well spending those few hours bouncing up and down was really fun esp
since i got to share it with my 2 best friends in melbourne eg and charles
we were standing in front of the speakers oh my poor ears i should have brought my ear plugs
theyre still ringing now more on the left ear though the left side facing the stage
irritated eg a lil though coz he was the designated photog
he being tall and all and i kept bugging him to take more photos
how many shots of him singing do you want one with every light change issit no lah but if can change angle also good lor
maybe i should go the other side to take tell you what lah
ill scan the photo and then flip it around for you ok hehe
highlight of the concert i went home with a souvenir a signature guitar pick that one of his roadies threw in my direction after the concert
yippeee next up emily of emerald hill on thursday
and possibly bic runga next month
im still lamenting the jamiroquai concert though
really wanted to get tix early on but no one to go with finally found out johannas going but shes got tix already and theyre seated ones not general admission apparently the ga ones are sold out
50 pm walked out of hifi bar
26 am just finished this blog entry
nitey nite ive an interview in the morning
ill be missing my sis performance at sonic fest 2002 coz i wont be back then
and it sounds like such a great gig too ah wells
announcement new shpiel new shpiel new shpiel new shpiel new shpiel new shpiel the column on your left
im still here in case everyones wondering im fine and no i havent flopped out of my goldfish bowl
speaking of which theres a new ad on tv right now featureing fishes swimming around a baby in his cot for some sorta baby monitor by fisher and paykel i think
not sure if anyone has seen it let me know
its essay crunch time again which means ive been piahing or at least trying to piah for my essays 1 due next friday and 3 due the following friday
as you can tell my days are packed and dreary and ive gotten to know the law library pretty well at least the section where i spend sitting on my butt and readingtyping
on an upside next week are the john mayer and emily of emerald hill performances
yes i know strange that im going to see ivan heng in drag once again as everyones favourite bibik in melbourne when i can see him in drag back home but i think tix are much cheaper here only paid 19 for an evening show
plus the theatres so close to home i can walk there
i wanted to check out other shows as part of the melbourne festival too but unfortunately with essays and all prob
am also on a job hunt for novdecjan summer hols
job sounded quite promising and they pay 16 an hour so thats good
but i gotta revamp my cv first though coz i think i need to sound more dynamic in order to get the job instead of just blah blah i did this and that
im taking tips from this guy at the seek
now i just have to get around to doing it b4 they close applications
on an upnote tomorrow me eg n charles are finally going to the imax theatre b4 our 3month ticket expires
such a waste of money if we dont get around to using it anyways ill prob
write more interesting stuff next week
not that my life is entirely very interesting anyways hehe
tata oh yes btw on chuckies recommendation check out this guy
were planning to do something like what he suggests giving out useful items and maybe cookies during christmas to the homeless
bels bday i spent yesterday and today with bel celebrating her 22nd birthday
it was very enjoyable yesterday we had a picnic at fitzroy gardens with egene
i got her a picnic lunch for her bday sigh which i still feel is a kinda cheapo prezzie
and also baked a cake
we had sandwiches potato gems crackers with kabana sausages and tasty cheese herb and garlic cheese spread strawberries and apples and coke to wash it down
throughly enjoyable and the company was good today we went to south melbourne beach took the tram down
we spent a couple of hours on the sand talking about stuff from relationships to people to school
then had tea at a cafe and talked some more
then had dinner with people from her church mostly her housemate jeans friends one of whom i found out much later was wallys housemate wow
dinner was fun at this place called malaya inn in doncaster nice yummy food like or jian fried oyster omelette fish head curry sambal kangkong etc
and even bowls of chicken soup mmmmm
it was followed by coffee at brunettis which i hadnt been to since its renovation
didnt stay long though coz charles n eg came to pick me up soon after their dinner and m1 concert
the people i met today seemed really nice would like to hang out more with them if i could
nice to get to know new people
im also beginning to hang out more with a bunch of people from church which is great and a long time coming considering ive been at accf for more than a year
guess im finally fitting in and finally finding my place in the scheme of things esp
btw ive graduated from alpha course on wednesday with my own certificate and everything alpha is sorta a backtobasics course in christianity which eg and i attended and after many months finally finished it off reinforcing the knowledge we have and making many new friends anyways back to today
id wanted to bring my camera and take lotsa pics so that i could stick it into an album or collage for bel to remember but arghfff forgot the camera sigh
sad right there goes a nice prezzie idea
chatting with bel was nice
its interesting how our friendship had evolved i never really liked her from the start which she tells me is what happens with practically every girl she meets they automatically dont like her for some reason so poor thing right she says sometimes she acts a lil bimbotic just to seem more affable to people coz shes naturally assertive
me i dont have that problem im naturally bimbotic heheheh
i didnt like her then coz i must admit i was a lil intimidated by her coz shes quite confident and assertive and also very babe hehe which i still think so plus her manner wasnt very i dunno warm n friendly a little aloof sometimes and when she was friendly she seemed superficial and very pr
plus we didnt have much in common to talk about too
but we get along better now and talk about stuff
she made a good point that we should try to hang out when were both in spore or itll seem like we just hang out with each other here and now coz we dont have any other close girlfriends here
thinking about it its partly true though coz bel and i arent exactly personality matches in a way but thats coz our friendship is still progressing
i personally think everyone has friendships with others on different levels
like how i interact with people like say charles or velle and priyanca is different how i interact with bart is different from how i interact with bel different from how i interact with my housemates and different for eg of course
with the first category and also with my housemate evie im a lil crazier and silly and loonier
but when im with eg or shawn a lil less loony and loud coz eg keeps telling me im too loud with bart im more affectionate and with bel im more sedate coz were still establishing our friendship and havent come to that supercomfortable point yet
i think the true litmus test will be to see her reaction to one of my silly songs then il know
literally part 2 i walked slowly towards the tram stop
all the while feeling sad and praying
help suddenly i stopped in my tracks
waitaminit wait a minute before i left the lecture hall i threw a plastic bag into the bin
now it had made an unusually loud thunk when it landed which was why i picked it up again and looked at the contents of the bin
but i didnt see anything so figured maybe a can or something just toppled over when i threw the plastic bag in
that thunk couldve been my phone as i recall i was holding my phone in my right hand i must have let it go along with the plastic bag excitement bubbled up inside me
i ran for the security station again praying in tongues all the while
panting and out of breath i knocked on the window
hold on im gasping too much
i explained my theory and he just laughed goodnaturedly
sarah youre killing us he called keith again and i ran to meet him at the underground parking garage to walk back to the theatre
we walked back in anticipation as i apologised to keith for making him walk back there again
i was telling god if i can find it im just gonna say thank you jesus and use this as testimony man i was so sure
we reached the theatre and i ran for the bin
pushing my sleeves up i dug into the bin which housed a few coffee cups my kfc plastic bag and used tissues
but i knew i heard a thunk so i shifted the bin aside and loandbehold it was there neatly resting against the wall undamaged
woopadeedooo praise god i jumped up and down in excitement and even grabbed keiths arm shouting thank you thank you he smiled and said thats ok as long as you dont make me come back here again i grinned back
we walked out and i kept thanking god
i suddenly remembered that i had promised to proclaim jesus name in this situation and id forgotten to
suddenly i felt nervous about it saying it out loud
i whispered loudly thank you jesus
dont know if keith heard
i realised i was being a chicken about it so as we were walking i said wow thats amazing i really thought id lost my phone keith turned and nodded
yeah its really a miracle that i found it i mean most people never find their phones i really thank god man
amen amen i said stressing on the erm
as we emerged from the shortcut through the carpark i looked up at the sky and suddenly everything seemed so beautiful to me
the trees the damp ground the cold air
i raised my hands a lil and whispered thank you lord
epilogue i walked back towards the guard station with keith
before he left i said thank you agian and asked for his name giving him mine as well just in case we ever bumped into each other again around the campus
i walked up towards the guard window and waved at angelo through the glass holding my phone up for him to see
praise god btw that the bunch of us were the last few to leave that way i knew who was locking up and so could locate angelo at the guard station
i boarded the tram and thanked god once again for his blessings
i bumped into another friend on the tram and shared my testimony with her
our gods really an awesome god
literally i walked towards the tram yesterday as the wind blew and the last hints of twilight shone in the sky
40pm and id just spent a good 45 mins or so just chatting with jessie after lecture while she waited for tammy to finish class
i had a nice time just having coffee and talking about school jessies so easy to talk to
anyway since it was pretty close to dinner time i figured id better give eg a call n let him know i was on my way back
i reached into my jacket pocket
and found it empty arrrgh where could it be i checked my bag rummaged through it
as the pit of my stomach started to swirl my brain kicked in
i probably left it in the lecture hall or something
better go find the security guard who locked it
so i ran to the station hoping to somehow locate the guard
he was there manning the station angelo was his name a guy in his late 20s30s and he was kind and friendly enough to call another guard to walk with me back to the theatre which was right at the other end of campus
so me and keith this tall man with a moustache probably in his 40s walked in the cold back towards the theatre
where else do you think it could be i dont know
have you checked it no not yet
we walked up the steps to the theatre
i walked in and searched the area where i sat
he looked up and down the theatre steps too
sigh its ok ill check with the library
i walked back towards the library where id gone with jessie to zap lecture notes
i put on my jacket there so i figured it must have slipped out then
i checked with the librarians and the lostandfound counter there
i tried calling eg on the payphone and jons house phone but no one picked it up
my heart dropped as i registered the fact id probably have to spend a few hundred bucks to get a new phone
money that i found hard to part with
all this while i was begging the lord please lord please
yet was resigned to the fact it was probably gone
people adhere to the finderskeepers mentality over here i lost my sunnies a month back and never saw it again
let alone a phone i walked in dark back to the cafe where i had coffee with jessie
it was probably closed though it was already 7 plus
the ground was damp the air cold
i shivered as my toes gripped my birkie sandals
a light people were still there i knocked on the glass door
were closed said the girl on the inside
she gestured with her hands that they were closed
hey john theres someone at the door knocking she said in a nasal voice
im sorry were closed duh i knew that already
im sorry but did you guys see a mobile phone in here i yelled through the glass door
what i said i think i left my phone in here he opened the side door and i explained myself
sorry we just cleaned up and didnt see anything
oh its ok ill leave a note in the the cafe in case i find anything so you can check back tomorrow thanks
i trudged on towards the student union info desk in the vain hope that someone might have picked it up
i scrounged through my bag again then decided to return to the library to call someone
the only other number i had memorised was charles so i called him
charles i squawked i lost my phone huh how dont know lah
must have dropped it somewhere
do you have chris number im trying to call pple at home but no ones picking up ok hold on ah
he gave me the number and i lamented how id have to buy a new phone
he offered to sell me his other phone the one he had but wasnt using at the moment
i said see how still praying that i might find it
i tried calling my phone in case the person who found it picked up
or at least if it was switched off at least i knew for sure it was gone and could move on
it was on vibrator mode though so maybe whoever had it didnt hear it
i retraced my steps again
tune in tomorrow to read the next episode of
why why is it that you can never repeat that freshfromsalon look even after spending hours adding mousse to your hair my hair looks more bobbish than sleek n funky
i dont know how the guy at the salon did it with his creme and his scrunching fingers but it looks weird now
or maybe coz im trying to do it with bedhair and not freshly blown washed hair
whatever it is i cant repeat the look
why is it that even though your body is aching and tired your mind is still awake so you just cant fall asleep i spent the other night in an insomniac stage and ended up watching informercials
i am actually seriously considering buying one of the products winsor pilates from the website hmmm
why is it that even though i have things to do like essays and such i can never fully concentrate on them instead i end up getting distracted by tv and the like
oh theres the computer oh maybe im hungry
hmmm maybe i should go mend the hole in my tshirt
why is it that even though i have school later and i havent done my readings and my stomachs rumbling coz i havent had lunch im still stuck here blogging drawn like a moth to a flame sigh
in the words of that great poet john mayer tell me why
thanks thank you one and all for the support of my first limerick as such i have come up with another my second limerick there once was a phone that rang all day but the person on line had nothing to say hed hee and haw then mee and maw finally deciding hed rather not play yeah i know its not very good
i still like the doncaster one better hehe
highlights of the day i streaked my hair red and cut it short till about chinlength
it was a very interesting experience at the hairdressers considering how its actually a hair college pivot point
after months of looking longingly at the model on the poster at the salon i finally did it
very vivid colour and the cuts pretty good too
everyone seems to think so hehe i got reviews from wicked and gorgeous to dont go back to long hair in a hurry and eh quite nice ah hor anyways as i was saying the hair college
this nice korean lady a student of course cut me hair for me
it was an interesting experience coz shes only been in australia for a year so her english wasnt really good
we managed to communicate though
she reminded me of one of those japanese housewives who you always see in those jap soap dramas
i was talking to her and found out she is graduating in december and from there working at her motherinlaws salon
hmmm trying to impress the inlaws well she was cutting it halfway then her supervisor walked by this tall hulking guy with bulging biceps thick veins and a tight tshirt
he took over for most of the haircut showing her how to feathercut my hair using a razor an advance technique which she hadnt learnt yet
he did a pretty good job looked nice n layered and i think made my hair look a lil finer
ahem he also said i had great hair and after the cut he said i looked unreal heheh
i quite liked it esp
considering i was afraid to cut too short in case it didnt fit my face shape
the korean lady jung was also noting details about my hair in a form as we went along a prerequisite for the college i suppose
flipping through it i found out my hair is in good condition porous and my scalp is normal yay the selsun blue 5 for dandruff works
and all this considering i blowdry my hair everyday and the price are you ready for this for a wash cut halfhead highlights and blowdry its only 55 fiftyfive bucks wooohoooo now if only i can get the same results the next time i return to the salon
great the first time but they cant seem to repeat the same thing the next time round
after the cut i went to priceline and got some hair products a bottle each of this new sunsilk frutrience for coloured hair shampoo and conditioner which also got me a free frutrience cosmeticsvanity bag and also wella moussewax
i tried the mousse just now but it didnt have as much hold as id like wanna try some funky upturned flips at the edges of my hair so i might pop down to priceline again and get the styling mud
well as for tomorrow id better start on that essay thats due on monday eeps and ill be busy on saturday afternoon and a lil on friday too eek
yummers had a very nice night today making really yummy strawberry yoghurt icecream
its sitting in the freezer now setting and by tomorrow i should have a delightful dessert woopadeedoo that said tomorrow also marks the beginning of essay work coz ive an essay due on monday
hollywood one which i caught a lucky break i
e turned out i had 2 extra weeks to do it
but have i spent the time wisely doing more research no
why coz i deserve a rest dammit teeheehee
oh yes went down to town today to alter 2 pairs of jeans
one was the just jeans one which i bought on friday the other a sportsgirl one which ive been wearing a lil suakuly i
with the hem folded up a huge chunk
did you know that alterations can be done and returned on the same day i didnt thought id had to wait a couple of days coz of all the hemming and tailoring all these people must do
well as i found out jj has an inhouse seamstress who does it on the spot
unfortunately she wasnt in today so i left it to be collected tomorrow
as for the sportsgirl one they send it out to be altered to a place just across the road called melbourne central tailoring
it was on the 1st level of an office building in a tiny little room at the corner
i almost thought i was on the wrong floor coz the lift doors opened to reveal a solicitors office with its tinted glass windows and couches
it was only after hearing voices from my left and spying a small rack of blouses hanging near a door that i found the place run by this really nice n friendly couple
the lady was talking to a jeans west salesgirl i figured jw also sent their jeans to be altered there
she was holding a couple of bags so the man smiled and told me to hold on awhile
and the price was right too after calling several places earlier in the morning i found out they were the cheapest charging only 10 yes yes please dont compare to far east prices ok if i were back home id have gotten my grandma to do it for me for free she was a seamstress after all
id have sent the just jeans pair to them too except for the fact that jj charges only 5
50 to do their own jeans with a receipt of purchase of course
all in all am quite excited to collect them tomorrow
beautiful collision she was shy and looked a little uncomfortable to be on stage for all to see
but her voice was beautiful enchanting ephemeral even as the notes that rolled off her tongue disappeared into the air like little bubbles of lilting melodies popping in the darkness
is someone smoking pot in here did you know that giraffes communicate with each other into ultralow sonic frequencies i just saw that on the discovery channel
yeah coz i thought for the last song there where it goes sings a low tune the giraffes could have done it well
the band playing with her were pretty quirky and easygoing too peppering the performance with comments and laughter
the group was fun to watch and great to listen to there was chemistry and they seemed so relaxed and happy to be on stage and were so totally devoid of the performance anxiety that grips most background musicians who generally intensely focus on their playing and ignore the interactionwiththeaudience bit
after the last song of the set which was her hit single sway from her debut album drive she mimed to the audience that this was the last song she was going off stage we were supposed to clap yell encore and then she would come out again hehe acknowledging the farce that are last song performances coz theres always an encore
confession i teared when she sang drive as part of her encore performance coz i dunno it sounded so melancholic and it reminded me of my sis and how shed describe the drivearounds shed have with ken and then i thought of my sis and how i missed her and i dunno the whole general atmosphere i suppose
sigh whadda wuss i am
i think i might end up liking her first album more will go take a listen and see if im right
check out bic runga and her latest offering beautiful collision
killing heidi rocked man the gig was worth the 3 12 hour wait as 3 opening bands performed kh came on at 11
there we were me and debbie in the crowd up front as charles jas and kelly watched from an elevated step
half the crowd in front of us were jumping up and down the other half bopping and the rest behind us watching with cool aloofness while amidst all this stood two asian girls headbanging their brains out arms flailing about looking like a cross between scarecrows on acid and chickens coming in for a landing
and it was pretty short only about 1 hr long
we wanted more the gig left us on a natural high debbs wound the car window down and screamed into the night breeze scaring the woman in the car next to us at the traffic light while i just kept smiling and going wooohooo
a bunch of kookies we were
but we had so much fun and i havent done this in a really long time a couple of years in fact so it was great to just let go at the gig especially since we were anonymous beings in a sea of unknown faces
im sooooo glad i went and sooooo glad that debbie went too to be my rockin partner
coz its not really something you can do alone you know you need a friend next to you doing the same wild things so you wont feel too insecure even if there is a crowd of people around you
two banging heads are a whole lot better than one whatever it is i highly recommend doing this
lets lock n loll duuuuuuuudes
rove live i hope the what the
ive sent in makes roves list for the final show next week
found on a save the environment pamphlet by the body shop under ways to save water take a shorter shower or shower with a friend what the
do you have a what the
you can contribute please leave a bl00p or a flooble
had a nice day today hanging out with charles watching the banger sisters and then having dinner and a date with eg
i was bugging him after dinner to be spontaneous and to go somewhere like the beach or something
coz we never really do anything like that or go out on dates anymore usually if its just the 2 of us its just running errands together or something
so yeah had a nice time at st
kilda beach and at the cafe at the end of the pier
we talked and laughed and joked around and generally had a great time
eg found my keys we initially thot hed lost it and wed have to cough up money to get a new one requested from the body corporate coz its a security key
but wot a miracle see hes been in and out of his car countless times since yesterday night when hed thought hed lost it
hed driven to church to search to the post office and today he drove to church reparked the car etc
all in all he was in the car many many times
and today after work at the church office there it was lying on the seat in broad daylight as if someone had just placed it there freaky no either someone had somehow gotten into his car taken the key made a copy or something and placed it back there without stealing the car or breaking any windows
or a miracle was at work
touched by an angel eh they mustve been watching
in other news got the bic runga cd beautiful collision today at jb hifi for 18 can u imagine id wanted to buy it earlier so good thing i didnt
i was even in jb hifi yesterday but just bought the killing heidi album which im really enjoying rite now figuring since i had an online voucher i could use for the cd
that didnt work out which was just as well coz today was the start of the jb hifi christmas sale can anybody say woohooo wooohooo echo
music makes the people come together
how would i describe by taste in music i say eclectic
or in other words rojak
i never really listened to music other than christian praise n worship growing up since i was living with parents who thought rock music is not edifying to your soul
why listen to all this trash when you can listen to something good not quite rock music is from the devil though pretty close
but it does make a lotta sense in retrospect i guess
after discovering that there was alternative christian music ie
same genres like rock dance etc
but with christian or more sanitised language i was into that for awhile
since jars of clay was pretty cool
then it was bossa nova and all that jazz
i listen to anything and everything
a bit of killing heidi a little diana krall some foo fighters some john mayer a twist of disco montego a dash of bebel gilberto and jobim some cafe del mar series
like i said its pretty rojak
after a long time trying to figure out my music tastes i realised i can blend in as easily into a jazz lounge as i can in a moshpit like this sat
at the kh gig phew gonna get me some bruises
woohooo i shall not be typecast i am a unique individual that subscribes to a blend of commercial music hur hur
most underrated band a new zealand outfit called eight who came down to spore a couple years back
i met the guys and they were really really nice and funny too although a couple of the ones i knew have left since
their musics really different so if you get a chance to check em out itll be great
i personally cant really describe the music or put it in any category
and theyre playing for big day out in new zealand next jan too kewl huh darn too bad not in oz although nz is a hop skip and jump away
happy birthday kenneth 21 november 2002
training again todays 5 hr shift was slow but still cool
i made my first full coffee drinks as in mailk and foam and all and served to customers
mike my boss said i did a pretty good job and the foam really turned out well so im pretty happy yay favour lord learned to clean the machines too
next week ill be doing the busy morning periods 7
30am where the orders just keep pouring in
training it went really well and the time just flew past
3 hrs taken up in a whirl of coffee making and pounding
i can honestly say im really enjoying myself
its was really fun and not too stressful coz the queensberry n lt
bourke store isnt as bz as the rest of the gjs outlets in town
in other news my silly iron has broken down
maybe the fact id dropped it accidentally from the ironing board has something to do with it
whatever it is its gonna be hell to fix
my cough and slight flu is still going on
all the honey drinks and gargling with listerine doesnt seem to help
this post was brought to you by the letters b h and g and by the number 33 arghf
it was a high of 33 degrees celsius today
i felt like i was back home in singapore
except unfortunately i do not have the luxury of entering my room to turn on the airconditioning because well golly gee i dont have one its sweltering the heat is intoxicating stifling almost as if yr baking in an oven
even the fan that rotates near your face does not provide a reprieve except to blast dusty air into your stuffed right nostril ive got a bit of the flu at the moment
so the nap i took in the afternoon or rather evening woke up about 8pm and there was still sunlight i tell you
ill never get used to this left me feeling groggy and more tired than i was before
i can only describe the feeling in one word bleuuurghghhffffgg
and the next coupla days promise to be worse
its rollercoasting up and down from 23 tomorrow to 33 the day after to 19 the day after that to 23 on thursday again
well weather predictions change on a daily basis so maybe it wouldnt be that bad
birthday part deaux yup yesterday went well although the picnic at the beach became a picnic behind the bathhouses coz the wind was so strong
it was nice and sunny at mid brighton beach but way too windy
overall it was fabulously delicious i got some nice piccies of the colourful bathhouses that looked like they could only fit 2 human beings plus their pet turtles ie
oooh we went to hunter gatherer at acland street st
kilda and picked up a really nice skirt for about 19
kewl eh charles says it makes me look like jungle girl ah but what da hey you only turn 23 once
soon itll be 25 then 30
ever get the feeling anyways for dinner eg brought me to this v
nice restaurant by the baybeach in williamstown called anchorage restaurant
i had the sirloin he had the eye fillet even though that place was more of a seafood kinda joint
we ordered the only 2 steaks on the menu
by boy delicious and the company was good although it strayed to topics like is it possible to make drunken fries or like flambe it or something
to which we started enacting how wed do it like cup hands together heres a potato jerk arm as if adding seasoning add wine followed by flick thumb as if lighting a cigarette lighting it and then move hands together quickly as if imitating a fire that goes fooooooooom ta daaa 10 mins later
eg hey what are those me chewing a rather large piece of mediumrare steak
cup hands together jerk arm as if adding seasoning flick thumb as if lighting a cigarette move hands together quickly as if imitating a fire that goes fooooooooom eg potatoes me excitedly pointing left index finger to nose and right index finger to eg nodding vigrously cheeks full of food the highlight eg eh you dont want the mushroom ah me mushroom what mushroom eg er
me its a mushroom oh my goodness i thought it was a really burnt slice of potato like flambed or something yes my blonde roots were showing
my parents called later to wish me a happy birthday as well as my sis this morning
and bart too half and hour ago note to bart its ok i still love you how does it feel to turn 23 i really dont know
ask me again the same day next year
shameless plug its my birthday today woohoo was born 23 years ago at 1
so far ive gotten a really cool laptop backpack for my luverly ibook from eg charles and wally and very adorable sabi underwear from bel
its blue striped with a goldfish in front she was very excited about it hehe
although charles insists it isnt a goldfish its just a fish thats orangegold in colour
looking at it yeah maybe but me and bel will insist it is a goldfish for my namesake were going for a picnic at brighton beach later and a nice dinner just me n eg later tonight
how we decided on brighton beach was really amazing we were scratching our heads as to where to go for a nice picnic
so i thot hmm somwhere not too far out but still away from the city
maybe a beach or the countryside
figured hey weve passed brighton beach a coupla times on our way to ikea in moorabin why not give it a go i still wasnt sure though
then eg came home so i asked him where should we go how about brighton beach i stared at him while scrambling to find in my brain whether id mention the location to him earlier on the phone or icq or something
youre kidding i thot of it too oh my gosh yeah shawns been there once siad it was pretty good
oh my gosh its a sign i tell you i even asked evie about it just now
maybe god wants us to be there or something
maybe he does well see
its amazing how excited i get about the lil things in life
will let ya all know what happens next
did you know that how you hold your chopsticks means how far away your future partner is did you know that you can eat the fishs bones if theyre fried enough
qn which part of singapore are you from oh singapore isnt very big its actually smaller than victoria
we dont really have states
yes yes such are the pearls of wisdom that spewed from my mouth at an alarming rate at the staff meeting
i really hope people didnt leave thinking god that weird chinese girl talks waaaay too much
coz thats what i think i did
left people with bits of information that they didnt really want to know
on the up side i think overall it went pretty well
the other staff pple were nice and so was the meal at kun ming restaurant at lt
its been there for ages apparently and got a huge doup recently leaving it looking pretty posh
other than my inanities it was mostly coffee talk
i dont think ill get as many hours as id like to work judging by the training schedule
so wont make as much i guess
but i have a good vibe about the job
the boss the pple the place the uniforms which me boss has to reorder coz they were a lil too big
theyre also pretty strict about attire no earrings minimal jewellry etc
oh wells not that i have any outstanding piercings anyways
and praise god the jobs starting 1 week later than scheduled on dec 9 so that means i get to go church camp woopee woopee mostly coz i get to surf hehe
anyways those were the highlights
hope things work out with colleagues and i gotta study for a gloria jeans exam regarding coffees and the machines etc
like once a customer enters a store how soon must you greet himher answer within 8 seconds
thats what im talking about
what sign of affection are you brought to you by quizilla
what sexy girl are you brought to you by quizilla
bow down to the red dragon
just returned from the movie it wasnt too bad albeit a lil predictable towards the end
does anyone know if the ending was the same as the book kenneth believes its different shant say more or ill be accused of being a spoiler
anyways just thot some areas could be developed more like the relationship between reba and francis aka mr d
aka red dragon aka psychotically repressed and emotionally abused serial killer
wasnt much space for edward norton to strut his stuff though
same goes for ray fiennes
emily watson was very convincing as reba the blinking kewpie doll
that aside i also went to borders and almost bought a book white teeth by zadie smith was it smith although was stopped at the last minute by shawn who said it sucked
he said he was willing to give me his copy which was back in singapore though
i spent a good 20 mins trying to finish reading the glamour mag that id started the last time i was at borders
at 11 a pop i dont have the moola to spend on buying imported mags so its borders free browsing for me
never got to the last page but did read an interesting article by kristen gore schiff al and tippers daughter btw regarding women work and motherhood and why cant women have it all without compromise
read it again to relook at the fine points she brought up
did you know that australia and america are the only two developed countries which have unpaid maternity leave tsk tsk
uk has 18 days while hungary has 24 a couple months back there was a huge hoohaa regarding a bill that a womens coalition was trying to pass that they get to have up to 3 years maternity leave
some said it wasnt economical to keep a woman at the company and have her retrained when she returned
me im not quite sure where my stand is coz i dont enough about the properties of the bill nor do i know how much maternity is enough nor do i know what the socalled economic costs are
so gotta find out so i can weigh out the costs and see where i stand
i do believe however that the company she works for should be supportive and allow her enough time to spend with her child and not penalise her in monetary terms
in short motherhoodhousehold maintenance etc
is work i wonder if anyones written a thesis about the whole leavethenursingtothemaids issue in asia
how does that affect a womans stand and her power relations with men and other women other than the gender issue it also becomes somewhat of a class issue too
any thots leave a bl00p
check this out man its soooooo ami
and notice the landscape upon which theyre fighting on
aint macs so multifunctional and also luverly bearbrick
would you like boobs with that i really really cant stand jennifer love hewitt
or else intensely dislike whichever way you take it
sitting here in front of the computer listening to the whingerock that is bare naked for the gazillionmillionth to the power of nth time all i can think to myself is god i hate jennifer love hewitt
how can anyone not stand someone who tries to rip off another singers moniker for goodness sake j
love holy moly ron kenoly and the party of five days and cant hardly wait and her bobbly breasts and her puppy pouts
ask me about the jennifer love frownpout the next time you bump into me
would you like boobs with that ironically after i wrote this post i got into suelees car and there blaring on nova 100 was you guessed it thaaaat song
it was as if the planets had specifically aligned today to add salt to my bare naked wound to rub my nose into jennifer loves perky bosom for daring to take her pouty highness name in vain
epitaph picture a quiet graveyard in the longdistant future with craggly grey stones the smell of green green grass the trees overhanging as the sun streams through in the fading twilight
you stroll among the chirping birds the flittering dragonflies the people walking their dogs amidst the calm serenity
then you stop at my tombstone and etched into the granite are words of wisdom that will follow you eternally
i cant reply to that because i am dead
a cryptic message from beyond the grave yet quirky enough to embody my character my nature my innate
whatever you say i cant reply to that because i am dead
had meant to write this entry for a while now dunno why i forgot to
amis blog entry reminded me of it not to bear any disrespect to her entry of course hehe
essay garble on dominant ideologies perpetuated via melodramatic forms on television such as the soap opera and even my fav
tv show of the moment 24 due to their associations with the domestic sphere and the lack of final resolution
essay crap on how looking for alibrandi can be constituted as part of italian national cinema even though the entire film is set and shot in sydney australia
essay vomit on omar calabreses ideas of television seriality and the five dominant prototypes

and based on the fact that im turning 23 next week ahem ahem hint hint ill be paid a higher wage than most others its award rates over here so the older you are the higher the pay
downside thos that some pple wont hire you knowing they have to fork out more
even after tax which i can claim back anyway ill still be taking back a pretty decent wage
woohoo well they say good things come in threes
im just waiting for the third
have you ever im just wondering is it just me or does everyone sorta put on an accent when they speak with ang mohs after years of thinking such people as le poseur ive come to the conclusion that we cant help but do so as a natural human effort to communicate with others clearly
if we speak a lil like em theyll understand us a whole lot betta
case in point a couple of weeks ago i was checking around for prices for bellypiercing bel wanted to give it a go so i was sourcing for the costs
ended up calling this guy who turned out to be a pharmacist who did all sorta piercings for pple along with his wife who was a doctor hygiene
i rang up and somehow ended up with a twang as i spoke
this usually pops up when im a lil nervous too lapsing into my valley girl mode
hi im just wondering if you guys like do bellypiercing yep we sure do
oh how much does it cahst well its 75 but its pretty cheap
you sound like youre from america
momentararily caught offguard i said the first thing that popped into my head to explain the accent
oh which part sawrry i mean where are you from erm america but im in melbourne now
oh erm er thats all right heh
i was trained in san francisco myself so i know that youre getting a good price here
are you a melbourne uni student erm yeah im an
well melbourne uni students get a discount so thats about calculate calculate calculate 63
yeah so if i decide to make an appointment ill ring you guys yeah thanksverymuchseeyabyebye
if anyone else has done silly stuff like this please let me know so i dont feel so alone in this world
emily of emerald hill impressions of the lady sitting 2 rows behind us emily played by ivan heng says something lady behind us mmmmmm
emily says something else lady behind us mmmmmm
emily asks everyone if they know the recipe for pineapple tarts lady behind us pineapple sugar er mmmmm
other than that the play was hilarious and ivan heng was great as everyones favourite peranakan bibik
especially when emily started interacting with the audience and pulled this woman on stage as she was getting to her seat she was late thank god we got to the theatre just as they were closing the doors
made her stand in the corner while everyone laughed but the woman was laughing too and enjoying herself
she was finally allowed to return to her seat though after apologising to the class
shouldve been the lady sitting behind me
4 days till big jons birthday 7 days till essays end 9 days till charles birthday 14 days till mine 28 days till the bic runga concert of which i still have to purchase the tix 54 days till christmas
what else is there to look forward to
does everybody know what time it is its
30pm here and i havent gotten started on the rest of my essays
i just wish everythingll get done soon
essay time of course also means that my room and bed got vacuumed the toilet got scrubbed and the hallway got vacuumed as well
oh the life of a procrastinator
havent had time to run through the archives though but the stuff ive read so fars pretty good as usual
very ami but more acid and bite
thats not too say that amis doesnt have bite
in fact the girl literally bites
eg had her teeth imprints on his leg for awhile
i hate daylight savings time for the fact that i lose an hour in spring
so last sunday spent turning my clock forward i lamented over the fact that i have even less time to do my essays
i should get back to work
note to self never ever ever talk about toilet paper that scratches your bum over the phone while sitting on the steps in a semiunladylike manner
you never know who could walk by and listen in on the latter part of the conversation and not realise that you were talking about ways to save money
that same person may also throw you a look thats a cross between disgust and confusion before rerouting their path past you
its quite fun to be a mamasan
its quite fun to be a mamasan its quite fun to be a mamasan hehe yep being the innkeeper at the lucky lucky best best holiday inn in bethlehem has its advantages whatever it is portraying a loud brusque sampat brothel owner at which the baby jesus was born proved quite a risque performance at tonights church christmas dinner
but it went down pretty well everyone laughed and i kept having the aunties and uncles coming up to me and patting me on the back for being such a good actor heeeheee
although some people say it wasnt really acting i was just being myself
i wonder what they meant by that
people laughed at unexpected bits too and especially at the last part where i started coming on to one of the three wise men
speaking of which their rendition of dancing kings to abbas tune was an instant hit coupled with stevens portrayal of a notsowise man bumbling around in his jester hat
it was priceless to say the least also spoton was uncle jimmys angel gabriel complete with flapping arms substituting as wings and a lab coat
remember joseph what mary says is true for women are always right ask the married men in the audience aaaah
the wisdom of an angel
special mention goes to emilys and amys graceful dance who pulled in the serious note of the play
sigh its just as well that i was mamasan and not one of the dancers lah wouldve probably fallen flat on my face
teetering on high heels are fine but swishing and turning and curving around to a ballad ill leave that to the professionals
yippee didnt do too badly for my essays better than i expected considering all the last minute work i did hehe
praise god it all turned out fine
yesterday night was a movie marathon as i spent a couple hours under the starless cloudy sky at the royal botanic gardens watching y tu mama tambien as part of the moonlight cinema festival
the festival runs for about 3 12 months till mid march with screenings of shows like grease or frida or my big fat greek wedding basically an eclectic mix of shows and even lord of the rings the two towers as the festival closer
following the nice picnic under the starless cloudy sky at the royal botanic gardens eg and i joined charles alan and shawn watching doubleoseven on the big screen at 12
45 am explosions and diamonds for everybody i have to admit though the films storyline was slightly more interesting than the bland catchmeifyoucan scenario played out in the last what 19 or 20 bond flicks this time hes renegade and the lorenzo lamas robinson crusoe look does become him somewhat although pierce baby you gotta work at those abs i spy some doubleo flab
recommendations lying on a mat under a starless cloudy sky at the royal botanic gardens accompanied by good food hot chocolate a blanket and a warm hug
pedal to the metal had my first driving lesson with eg today at a quiet carpark in kensington
it was awesome had lotsa fun even though it took me awhile to get the hang out changing gears releasing the clutch etc
eg said i did pretty well for my 1st lesson and that i caught on quickly
hehe hes a real good teacher actually encouraging and patient
so i could start all right
the only problem was stopping hahaha
took me a long while to get the hang of braking and coming to a gentle stop for some reason
in other news im playing the mamasan of the inn where mary and joseph crash at for the night in our churchs christmas play held next saturday
quite funny lah me teetering around acting like a cruella deville hamsap middleaged lady
i think my favourite line would be when i say to joseph aiyoh
either that or welcome to mamasans lucky lucky best best holiday inn how can i halpchoo egs flying back next sunday
well be seperated for about 6 weeks ill definitely miss him n i think its about the longest well be seperated for or was the hawaii stint longer though itll also be good to have some time apart and regroup
hows everyone doing btw yes this means you the reader of this fair blog
whoosh ever felt the rush of wind against your ears as you take hairpin turns at breakneck speed yep just did it paid 60 buckaroos to whirl around a gokart track for 1 hour
i left thinking man im such a wuss and how i didnt get my moneys worth for the 3 runs round the track australian grand prix rules coz i didnt overtake and cut corners as much as i shouldve
but dammit i was afraid of crashing and my arms were really tired from turning really had to use my arm strength
added to that id injured the middle finger on my right hand just minutes before the race playing air hockey
sigh the injuries from my gokarting expedition happened b4 the raced even started but going at pedeltothemetal speed on the straightest part of the track was such a scary experience
some people call it a speed rush me i call it time to pray
i think it was scary coz the turns came up too soon didnt get to enjpy the speed of that stretch b4 having to tap the brakes and make the turn without skidding
and when someone crashed into me boy was it painful lurched forward in my seat
i hate having other drivers really tagging close to me too so i just give way
i guess thatll make me a semisafe driver in real life which reminds me egs supposed to teach me next week
woohoo anyways i think ill try the other track up in sunshine soon the port melbourne one in a converted warehouse just seems too small
oh and with a smaller group so i dont have to keep slowing down when the amber lights start flashing coz someones just crashed
camp phew just camp back from camp
awesome experience will blog more tomorrow too tired
lord of the bathtub rings the two showers congratulate me people
today is the inaugural start of taking two showers a day a feat never before accomplished by yours truly since arriving in melbourne
thats because the weathers always been pretty good
even summer balmy and warm
today it was gluggy and hot
24am now and its 30 degrees outside eurk dang forest fires and depleting ozone layer
and its worse tomorrow 42 degrees i just wanna curl up and melt with the heat
but no i shall press on and leave the comfort of my home
for the comfort of an airconditioned shopping centre
i hope i find a good one
intense that was the expression on eminems face in 8 mile
the only 2 expressions captured on camera thoughout the movie
oh yeah and when he gets pissed off then thats beattheshitouttayouintense
phew the pic was pretty all right very characterdriven although it tended to drag a bit
parts i liked the scene where he rapssings to sweet home alabama in his words of course
also the touching couple of minutes when hes tucking his younger sis or daughter the movies pretty vague about it into bed and sings her to sleep
side note though emmy baby stick to da yohohorap n leave da singin to da professionals ya know what im sayin bro
oh and the mandatory shag scene id like to think was thrown in for good measure just to prove a he digs britney murphys character alex b to show how trite and meaningless sex is today and c just to please the bulk of the movies audience made up of adolescents wanting to be like em who are up for some gratituous shots of flesh esp
murphys although lets not forget the scene where he flashes a piece of his lilywhite ass to the audience as part of the rap battle royale sequence at the end
that said with those intense closeups of emmys face i think hes actually kinda cute
symmetrical features piercing blue eyes
in fact he could down right be a nice sweet ol guy
hes a romantic a passionate poet at heart his melodic lyrics inspiring this shattered world to greater heights
save for the parts where he wants to kill his exwife of course
theres no such thing as a free lunch but for charles there is coz he was sweet enough to drive me all the way to ardeer which is majorly far away although taking the m1 and west gate fwy cut the driving time considerably
if i were to travel by bus itd have taken me forever just think of travelling from pasir ris to jurong and back and theres only one bus that goes that way
and why was i doing in ardeer formerly known as deer park west anyways coz i was there to pick up my mobile phone which had accidentally slipped out of my bag in the bus that morning and ended up in the hands of a lil ol lady who didnt even know what it was she popped it into her bag and when she finally picked up the phone after id rung it countless times upon discovering its disappearance i was overcome with joy
considering the fact that she had no idea how to operate a mobile phone
after a long while trying to figure out where she lived her english wasnt very good i think shes italian and after calling charles countless times and after rearranging my meeting with bridget i was finally off to ardeer to meet this lovely angel who rescued my bloodline my mobile phone
where all my contacts and the free passsms to chicago were stored
mac opened the gate and returned the phone to me to which i gave her an impulsive hug so relieved i was
thats almostlosing my phone twice within a few months
i really have to get into the habit of looking behind me before i leave
who am i really and who am i to you
an attempt at typographic art
bloop bl00ps blooop blooop blooop bloopadeed00
cny just around the corner yep it is
and i have many things to prepare for the church picnic thats going on then on chu er specifically
like source for goodies and prepare flyers and organise transportation
many things to do but i guess it keeps me busy
to my fiathful readers yes all 3 of you
sorry i havent been updating regularly just been caught up with the daily grind of life ironic seeing how gloria jeans slogan is escape the daily grind geddit coffee grind oh never mind
so as you can tell the blogs been a little anorexic
that and coupled with the fact theres really nothing much happening in my life now
lets see maybe i should change my writing style
instead of a journalesque whathappenedtoday kinda report maybe i should just deliver quirky excerpts or at least working harder at putting a spin to the events that unfold daily
hows this for a change driving
euphorically exciting especially the feeling of controlling a revving machine under my feet
a small tap and it roars a release and it stalls
machinery built for ease yet deadly in so many ways
cant wait till the next lesson
maybe i should just stick to my day job
ah hah so thats what they do while the comps on sleep mode
courtesy of me sis blog
cruise control i had my first paid driving lesson today
lets just say im starting with another instructor on monday
coz sprint driving schools instructor really sucks in the personality department
he was this guy in his 30s gruff with curly hair nike sunglasses and bunker shoes
spoke with some pseudofrench accent and was talking to me as if i were a small ant nay the food that ants eat
so im going with shawns instructor
was planning to do so until he quoted me a slightly higher price 27 for 45 mins compared to sprints 25
so i figured since sprints first lesson is 20 with a free one before the test id just go for it then decide
so ill be meeting david and his latemodel toyota corolla at the vicrds carpark on monday
horns kept honking at me today as i took to the congested streets in the southbank area
phress youhr brahkes hwhy youh afrhaid of phressing yourh brahkes
tuhrn here tuhrn left here
while nary a smile cracked his kwali face veneer
hope the next lesson goes better
bleepin fooo parental guidance advised
this post contains explicit language which serves to highlight the reality of the situation
todays rude awakening was brought to you by a scruffy pudgy jerk who wouldnt know his right hand from a can of vb if he didnt occasionally have to pick his nose
there we were standing on the curb waiting to cross the road like lawabiding pedestrians when a few jaywalkers crossed over to our side
since there wasnt much room curbside with the crowd waiting for the lights to change two of them had to squeeze past in the space between me and the shop that sold motorbikes on elizabeth and abeckett
the third brusqely shoved past me and bumped me aside then had the audacity to blame me for not moving to accomodate his pudginess
hey i said when i felt the push
stupid fucking chink he said at the same time as he walked on
i was stunned then ranted to shawn and charles what an asshole shawn shouted to the guys retreating back hey whats the matter with you the pudge turned around
she didnt move outta the way
and that gives you the right to be rude have some manners man shawn replied before turning around
the pudge advanced towards us enacting acts of bravado you see only on tv spewing cliches less cornball than you wanna piece o me and more cheesy than bring it on
something more akin to the far east plaza bengs calltoarms of settle while flashing an orange comb with a pointy end
shawn turned around and faced him once again reprimanding him for being rude as the pudge defended himself eloquently stating so what hey you were the one that bumped into me ok i said
there they were two male peacocks in all their fiery glory fighting for a piece of lost pride jaws squared looking at each other straight in the eye the space between them the width of two fingers
and i was thinking where am i in all of this this isnt some bullshit attentionseeking rant that im spouting here but seriously if he had a problem didnt he have it with me as well after all wasnt i the stupid fucking chink that got into his royal pudginess way did i need shawn to defend my honour like a frail damsel in distress do i need to reminded even now that i would have slunk away muttering angrily before the shock of it wore off and i realised i should have retaliated or maybe i would have just turned the other cheek saying i shouldnt bother or sink to their level and used it as an excuse to hide my fear as im wont to do sometimes shawn just reminded me of the time at priceline when this skinny bleached blonde teen just stepped on my heels and when i exclaimed ow she just told me to move my bags from the bench and all i did was mutter bitch under my breath
he says we shouldnt let people like this get away with it
so what should i do i dont just go quietly which i used to do last time now at least i show my disapproval at others rudeness
but what about setting an example wwjd dammit sometimes i know what i can do maybe shout back a cheerful thank you for being so niiiice and god loves you and also just to unnerve them but a scathing comebacks so much easier to take on than love and peace or even a conciliatory nod of whatever
and maybe i just dont want to be nice or submissive
maybe i want to fight my own battles and show that i can hold my own against the rude ones men or women but especially men
as the brilliant plumage of the peacocks began to fold back shawn decided to turn around and walk off leaving the pudge to continue ranting hey we can do this right now man
the pudge just fudged his battle
charles asked what was it the guy had said that sparked the whole episode and as shawn replied a young aussie couple walking by us told us just to ignore that jerk
he doesnt know what hes talking about and unfortunately some australians are just idiots
not all of us like that we smiled yeah thats good to know
they smiled back kindred spirits for awhile
it takes all kinds doesnt it but what do i know im the other a woman of asian descent a small speck in this postcolonialist patriarchal world
forgive me for indulging in that piece of artyfarty knowledge hehe if my primary five teacher mrs koh were here shed have given him a stern talking to and washed his mouth out with dynamo for using such filthy language
thats what we need to keep the streets clean
a stout middleaged aunty who could hold her own against the young punks of today
try calling her a stupid effin chink
happy new year from all of us here at bloop bloop inc
we would like to wish everybody a wonderful 2003 full of possibilities cherished moments and blessings from the lord god bless everyone
counting crows dan vickrey thinks im cool at least my hair anyways says the lead guitarist of a truly fantastic gig on tuesday
too bad my seats were really crap and far up although we managed to slip into some closer ones
dan also said he wore a red shirt in honour of my favourite colour was wearing red birkies had a red bag and redstreaked hair
yeah roight like his shirt was really for my benefit
sigh too bad my birkies broke at the concert and the mrs potato head keychained to my bag lost her white hat
oh the woes of a concert goer
breathe yet again turning murmuring burning churning swirling gasping reeling frothing pumping blood air feeling emotions inside outside wont it stop please stop please please stop now
breathe again i remember a shpiel i put up awhile back which speaks infinite volumes about what i feel right now
its my first shpiel in fact
so now once again please rise for the encore performance of threat this was it
she had no place to run to hide
from beneath the folds of his trousers he produced his weapon a shiny object that glinted and reflected the singular beam of light streaming through the window and threatened her with it
backed up against the wall she had no choice but give in
she raised her hand as he slipped the object onto her finger and accepted his marriage proposal
written by sarah wong 4 june 2001 its amazing how a year and a half on your own words can come back to haunt you
many people are asking for a full description of what happened that fateful day saturday the 15th of february 2003 also incidentally the 15th day of the lunar new year yuan xiao jie or the chinese valentines day
i promise details will be forthcoming been a little busy lately with work and social activities
plus ive been repeating the story so often my mouth has gone dry
am a little tired of the story already eep
in the meantime hang tight and thanks for all the congratulatory messages its been great hearing from u guys and knowing youre sharing in our joy
happy birthday thats what i should have said to the dear 6 year old kid who told me her birthday was yesterday
instead i said oh congratulations sheesh it mustve been all the congratulations id been hearing all day so much so i got my salutations mixed up
every few moments itd be a person coming up to me at church congratulating me no not for performing herculean feats of magic but for getting a proposal
yes dear bl00p bl00p readers yes all 7 of u
hair again its more or less faded now so it isnt that orangey
unfortunately the streak that i like on the front seems to have faded too
not as dashing egs family have arrived and are doing well holed up at oakford mews off commercial rd in south yarra
really looks quite new very poshy and nice servicedapartments
and ethan is soooo adorable hes only a year and a half and hes already speaking and reading and counting he can count to a hundred and in multiples of two and read chinese words
and he knows the names of the authors who wrote his books like eric hill for his see spot run books etc
and everytime he goes aunty sarah read i just melt
cute intelligent and he smells so nice
eg got his new maroon holden vectra today
cant wait till i get to drive it around
i guess thats more or less whats been happening
havent had much of a chance to blog coz been busy
havent even been on the net all that often either i really wanna get away for a weekend though just to recoup and feel like ive actually had a holidayvacation this summer before school starts
and its starting in 3 weeks eurgh
so not lookign forward to it
but its the last leg
not the cut love the cut
what was supposed to turn out as a pink block at the bottom of my wispyish chinlength bob turned into a chalky orangeyred mess
and the best part was id spent 1
4 and a half hours doing it wah lau eh
3 hours to bleach it and it was still not white enough but me and the stylist a 17 year old sweet young student decided we should just go ahead a try it
then she had to mix up some colour coz they ran out of the one i wanted and the teacher said the mixll do
but combined with blondish hair it came out less funky pink and more hong kong ah lian
what should i do now should i dye it all black and maybe do a couple of red 20minute streaks or should i wait a week as suggested by one of the supervisors and bleach it again then do the colour myself using the fudge range of semipermanent colours dammit
good thing it was only 32
10 for the cut and colour
egs return has been pushed back another week coz of problems with his visa approval
something to do with the need for a police check coz hes stayed in australia before
and the oz high comm in spore isnt really helpful at all
plus they employ really grumpy women to front their counters and be rude to people applying for visas aka my boyfriend
must be all that power going to their heads
picnic wow todays cny picnic for church was a load off my mind
praise god for the good weather and everything went smoothly and everyone had a good time
all the running around blood sweat and tears was worth it
we had games a group skits cny karaoke competition and of course a lion dance oh man spent the whole night before sticking and layering the crepe paper onto cardboard boxes
if i had server space id upload some photos so u guys can check out
but trust me we had a lot of fun and lots to eat and everyone pretty much seemed to enjoy themselves and we also had sparklers too and lanterns
yes even though lanterns are more for mooncakelantern festival but hey its still chinesey eh a funny story i heard today btw
a group of the people from church were in chinatown enjoying the festivities when one of them got handed a booklet containing some facts and info about asian businesses in chinatown
she rejected it though saying im not asian under her breath
thing is shes chinese but she doesnt consider herself one i suppose
a couple of aussies there heard it too then smiled
i wonder why do 2ndgeneration asians sometimes deny their heritage its a whole issue ive been reading about for class the diasporic community in a new homeland and how the kids adjust being part of both worlds
about 95 of the people in my church are asians a good number being aussieborn asians
i wonder how they really see themselves most dont speak mandarin some occasionally follow their parents to visit relatives back home in spore or msia and a lot dont know a large part of their cultural heritage
few of the asianaussies turned up for the cny picnic today most were the intnl students and the adults
i guess now im beginning to appreciate and value the education i had growing up being forced to learn mandarin for 11 years o and aolevel chinese
some of it really sticks to your brain yah i guess if i end up settling down in a country where my mother tongue isnt widely spoken or part of the curriculum id also send my kids to chinese school just to learn a bit of their heritage language and culture something extremely important and marketable in this global age
they can thank me for it later
dates happy chinese new year had a great reunion dinner at alans place with his family sob so sad that i didnt get to spend it with mine
but theyre only a phone call away
btw did u guys notice that yesterdays date was 010203 hehehe cool huh
back home eg flew back yesterday to settle some visa stuff and praise god hes got it down n settled and it lasts till march 31st 2005
woohooo i called me mum yesterday to talk and yet again it turned into another session contemplating her worry over my brothers future
seems like the older ones acting up again understandable seeing how hes going through the teenage angst years but hes more difficult than shes imagined it to be and shes worried over the company hes been mixing with whove recently been caught shoplifting
stealing for the winona ryderesque thrill of it
and were talking about a pack of rich spoilt boys from his school here
bored rich kids who dont understand the value of money who bandy about their fathers wealth like a troupe of marauding monkeys sucking up innocents who wish they could be like them like my brother
maybe im being judgemental here but i honestly dont care just wish my bro would wise up
sigh the financial situation back home is really taking a toll on everyone
im hoping to apply for a bursary from school to help with living expenses at least till i graduate
i missed the boat on the rent one which subsidises about 60 a week but hopefully there are others i can apply for
its nostringsattached so prayerfully thatll work out somewhat to alleviate the financial burden on my parents
its quite pathetic how i keep running to god only when im in trouble or worried however understandle it is being a part of human nature
yet sometimes i wish i could find the passion i once had about church and reading his word yet am bogged down by the mundaneness of life such that i cant find a reason to or more appropriately face the inertia of picking up my bible to read and meditate
although i see myself reaching out some way in my little human form for that vast expanse that is spirituality and passion for god yet coming up short most times
is it the engagement of the topic however does the deliverer of the sermon exist to entertain or educate we and i say we in the broadest sense coz i think most of us tune out once in awhile learn when were receptive and humour creates such an environment
how much then do we learn when we switch off or dont connect with the speaker sometimes but beside the sunday agenda theres more work to do to on a daily basis building such a close relationship which to be honest makes me wish i could have a proper conversation with god as in hear audibly and see physically
are real relationships based on this the seeing and hearing and touching and feeling the tangibility of the other ah wells
back to my little worm hole i guess
numb today was a day spent waking up late rushing to work at 7am was supposed to be there at 6
30 only to be woken up by a piercing phone call at 6
45 rushing to school going to bridge road walking around hunting for a pair of good black shoes to wear to work and with jeans for winter coz the pair im wearing right now is literally falling apart failing to do source said pair going to myer in the city finding a good pair only to find out theyd sold out of the black one in my size curse my statusquo size 7 feet having the salesgirl call up all the myer stores in victoria finally finding the last pair in the whole of victoria and thankfully not too far away grateful for fiance for offering to drive me and my numb tired feet to doncaster to pick it up only to arrive at his office to sit about for one and a half hours waiting for said kind generous fiance to finish work and whisk me off to buy shoes
am also facing possibility that we might hang about westfield shopping town in doncaster for a bit when all i want to do is go home rest my tired aching feet and numb self and watch a good night of sitcoms on channel seven
oh curse late night suburban shopping centres
to paraphrase some famous person who saidwrotesang that

the carpets freshly steam cleaned and damp
my new room smaller than i imagined
todays the day that i found out i dont need an extension after all the due date for the assignment has been extended for all
today is the day i have to frantically pack the remains of my belongings and prepare for a new phase in my life
today is the day i leave evie and chris and jon and sturt street and great public transport behind
and say hello to kensington and mediocre public transport
today is the day i have to start reading for my understanding australian media presentation on thursday
today is the day i can watch 24 on tv instead of taping it

apologies so here i am facing a spectacular view of melbourne city the sun reflecting a goldyellow hue off parched walls and fresh concrete perched on my comfy black office chair in the law library
a quiet spot this is
i really should be doing my work
bah humbug who really cares about proppian narrative functions im sorry
because you all cant enjoy this view with me right now
so there they were chatting and laughing and joking around needlessly wasting time indecisively deciding where to lunch
and there i was waiting playing watchforparkingattendants which i hate stressfully seeing the precious seconds tick by when i could be doing research when i storm over in a cloud black debris
because i should control not react not express but repress and let it burn and not take it out on you
so there i was thinking culling worries sars money schoolwork missing out on my brothers teenage years
because i should be there for you guys to watch and teach and motivate
and here i am sitting facing a view reading how i should write more
should have entertained you earlier
but im back at least for now till my next disappearance
angst my brothers acting up again
going thru that whole teenagerebellion phase
i hope he wisens up soon and stops hurting the people around him who love him the most
i know it sounds patronising but well i am his older sis
i hope he knows we love him
bdays its miriams bday party today and were all going as pirates the themes out of the ocean or something like that heheh

a tribute to my father i will always remember my dad as a strong man with shoulders broad enough for sixyearold me to perch on he with the round tummy a twitch in his moustache and a twinkle in his eye
i remember the times us kids spent in the queensized bed he shared with mum playing i spy with my little eye as he picked out easy items within plain sight while we picked out items that couldnt possibly be hard to guess yet he humoured us and tried multiple times before we laughingly yelled out no pa its the tv lah i remember how he used to purse his lips together whenever he got mad a stern warning to stop being naughty before he brandished the dreaded cane
but i also remember how he restrained from lashing out when he saw my terrible alevel results and how he tolerated my first serious boyfriend even though he knew that guy was never right for me
and how he embraced the next now my fiance into the warm folds of our family
for all this i say thank you dad for being the head of our household for being inspiring and uplifting for being the earthly image of our father up above
thank you for caring thank you for loving and thank you for leading me in my life
god bless and i love you

television history why check this out wooohhoooohohohooooo
and yes tess the reporter is my sis
yo de lay hey hoooo i wonder how many people actually still read my blog i know i havent been blogging much so to calculate i would have to say its the number of people who actually know about this blog coupled with the trajectory of minute comet fragments floating down from space after burning up in the atmosphere multiplied by the incessant number of phone calls answered in the cinema by a loud ah an zua watching movie lah divided by the intensity of fear factor contestants projectile vomit after searching for objects in a tank full of live maggots with their mouths which brings me to a grand total of
two yes two people who read this blog regularly besides me
thank you charles and tessa whove left messages on my tagboard
i will never forget this

that said tomorrow nite at embargo should be a good one
i havent been there mostly coz ive been away of course and im not exactly the type you see raving up the clubbing scene

ill try to work on the first two
its gettin hot in here
and even though its raining and cloudy and stuff its still so hot and humid euch im often left feeling like one of those littleknown species of gnats u see on nat geo programmes all sticky and slimy and occasionally expelling venom through my pores
if only our country was fully airconditioned inside and out
workll be a breeze pardon the pun
more flashmobbin heres what happened at the latest melbourne flashmob

am blogging coz charles says i have to be faithful to my audience settling into a new role at work is a real challenge
i feel lost often directionless when it comes to this new project
but its wonderful at the same time to have a job in such a dynamic yet nurturing environment that allows you to breathe life into and concentrate on your walk with god
such a privilege and im getting paid for it too yay it really brings home the lesson im strong in your weaknesses to paraphrase the verse
praise god hes been so good to me
i pray for inspiration wisdom and guidance and the discipline to carry my ideals through

maybe share with you this one just heard from a visiting pastor from malaysia
pastor gan from malaysia shared that some years back he offered his home to shelter a village girl from ipoh who was an orphan
one day she had some food particles stuck between her teeth and asked this pastor friend of mine what to do
pastor gan offered her a string of dental floss and taught her how to do it
she went into the bathroom and didnt come out till quite some time
pastor then asked her did she floss out the food particle and she said yes
then handed the dental floss string back to pastor and said i washed it many times already
disclaimer ulu kampong girl is not descriptive of all girls from ipoh nor the greater area of western malaysia
kaploink just some random thoughts 1

i pity the people around me when the gas gets expelled one way or another
living the righteous life dying to self living and serving the one true living god
is damn hard pardon my french
and tho i know its worth it the turmoil of making conscious right choices has turned my world upside down on end
were not called to lead the easy life were called for greater things to be dynamic infusions that pervade humanistic hedonistic society
and sometimes i just want to crawl under a rock and give in to the tempations that rock my world that provide relief and not rest
to not think and just carry on in the doing of things
ay caramba in other news check out this site
rotfl came across this via my friend barts livejournal

the little prince by antoine de saint exupry er
dont steal my idea can
the suns shing outside and im feeling strangely disconnected
not feeling like doing any work but wanna just blughpz around
thats my new word for the day
if you feel like a leach just wanna go to the beach just blughpz
if you move like a slug just wanna settle on a rug just blughpz
there are just some days when you come off feeling inadequate and often times insignificant
tuesdays are those for me often times coz the exec
team meetings are long and arduous and whatever little i contribute seem of even lesser importance
most times its pretty all right its just that being surrounded by thinkers and visionaries and perpetuators of gods kingdom is pretty intimidating
plus the fact that it starts at 8
30 in the morning and coupled with the sore lack of sleep the previous night for goodnessknowswhat reason
sometimes i question my calling in this ministry this field
where do i truly fit in in all of this in the everchanging environment that ive been planted in a lot of issues on selfworth and centredness get thrown up in the mix and i have to keep reminding myself that theres a greater purpose involved and at stake
to be honest the sore lack of sitting down and meditating on his word and doing my devotions is probably a key cause of this
need discipline ah wells just a bit of a whinge sall
friends and friendsters alike im currently hooked on this whole friendster business and am unearthing friends and acquaintances from eons ago
its like six degrees of seperation gone mad currently with my personal direct network of 23 friends im linked to more than 140 000 people how bizarre is that although id have to say a friend did make a pertinent point
how many real friends have we made thru this crazy machination or are we just content finding longlost friends or is it the fun of bragging rights hey i have 245 friends and you only have 18 how pathetic are you so far the experience has been interesting
hooking up and messaging exclassmates and realising they know people whom i know too
like a primary school mate whos my sis colleague at sph and also a good friends girlfriends brothers girlfriend
oh you get the picture
ick icker icky what happens when u need to poop burp eat and fart all at the same time youre me for the afternoon thats what
and coupled with an intense pain that comes from gastritis induced by hunger plus the blockage of my large intestine due to a lack of bowel movements in the past few days im not a pretty sight
just thought id add a little grossness into your reading material for the day
memememememme sorta check out sarahwong
com ive mentioned her before
shes a really good photographer
took pics of andrea bocelli too sigh
wish i could take photos like that
came across this article via winnies xanga blog and a whole lotta questions ran through my mind
it throws up a lot of issues to do with the convergence of religion with mainstream pop culture and the harkening of being the salt and light of the world to influence rather than be influenced
in this case whos influencing whom mass media or christianity are we merely using whatever means necessary to reach todays jaded youth to reclaim popular culture or has popular culture claimed us is usurping pop culture a means to an end but to what extent has it become a turnoff jesus can be cool and he sure can be radical
but so what any thoughts
i feel it in my fingers
i feel it in my toes
so sings glamrock badboy hasbeen billy mack in the opening sequence of love actually
and he sings it so so well the ol geezer gyrating to the rhythm
but hes not the only one to gyrate or vibrate or translate or prostrate in the movie no
for tis the season to be jolly and love actually packs a punch the movie was hilarious tho the plot intricately weaving through various lovelives was predictably naff understated british humour never ceases to make me laugh till my belly aches
id expect nothing less from richard curtis the man who brought us bridget jones diary mr bean and the black adder series
and yes rowan atkinson does make a couple appearances
truth be told the movie should really be titled lust actually or luff actually
it charts the fluffluff lives of several characters in presentday christmas season london
and where it comes close to the true meaning of love choosing to love each day again and again despite mistakes and close encounters with infidelity it shies away preferring to gloss over its painful reality in favour of the sweet pure agony of being in love
one of the perks the movie offers is the fact that youd recognise most of the faces in the movie including emma thompson liam neeson colin firth bridget jones alan rickman the bad dude in harry potter kiera knightley bend it like beckham pirates of the caribbean and hugh grant as can you believe it the british prime minister like i said it was hilarious although i must say mr fourweddingsandafuneral can still charm the ladies with his foppish yet debonair ways
look out for the cameos
ponder ive just finished a book by francine rivers called and the shofar blew
its a very real telling tale of the lives lead by a pastor and his wife called to serve a local community when the churchs pastor retires
the book weaves intricately and into depth of the anguish the wife faces as her marriage disintegrates while her husband presses forward in building his ministry into growing a church that he hopes would please his dad the respected leader of a wellknown megachurch
its not a plotdriven book
the climax is almost predictable and the pace tends to dawdle at times
but the attention to emotional detail is amazing and you feel and cry and smile as the characters do while facing their daily demons
i expected to turn the last page and sigh with a breath of contentment of longing that the journey id begun had ended all too shortly
but surprisingly it left me cold
a cool splash to wake me up to alert me to the dangers of ambition getting in the way of ministry of being blinded by personal goals with no regard for wise counsel
are we building projects too fast steamrolling whatever or whoever gets in the way of progress am i constantly listening to the spirits guidance is this what the lord wants these questions were whirring through my head as i finished the last chapter
and i have no answers
and im glad for reading that book not just due to its entertainment factor but for the fact that it got me thinking
and to dwell on thoughts that challenge my approach to ministry my calling which may throw doubts in the face of faith always an unpopular approach
to think of what im doing and how it ties in with the purpose of my life and to think about why i choose to do what i do why i work on the projects i do right now whether im going along with the flow coz its my job do i truly believe what i say i should believe in for 2004 questions questions questions
at least im thinking and not following along like a blind herded sheep
the answers i believe lie somewhere along the lines of dying to my self the self thats lazy unmotivated procrastinating happy to coast along with whatever life throws at me
and i know thats not how life should be rolling with the punches drifting from pleasure to pain and back again
theres more wake up sparky
mother my mums coming on monday morning yippeeee till the 18th after my graduation
really wondering if the journey to marriage is worth it
sigh the ups and downs of coupledome
sometimes i just wanna give in to my animalistic instinct and be selfindulgent
be all dramamama and fling something against the fall usually the ring on my finger
its all in my head
just a bit of a whinge in the valleylull of my life
i realise i whinge more on my blog rather than expound on the good things happening in my life
really feeling the change in taking an active role of leadership in the church
even friends have pointed it out although a part of me is still reluctant to accept that i have changed and for the better too
im more passionate more vocal feeling the zest to be close to god
yet strangely hypocritical coz i havent been reading my bible or spending time praying as much as i should
and its not for anyones or gods sake that i do it mind you its really for my own
to wit i say onward christian soldier

a little birdie told me
heres an email from my mum
hi girls tell you something funny
last saturday invited some old friends for cny dinner including egenes parents uncle thomsas aunty rosemary
half way thru dinner i tried to switch on the tv to watch the chingay procession live but cant get it
i was asking them hey chingay what time huh then uncle tom and auntie rose started to look at their watches to tell me the current time
one old friend shouted oi you asking your chingay what is the time or you asking what time will be chingay be on then i realise egenes parents thought i was calling to them as chinggay in hokkien which means inlaws
luv mum all i can say is oh
hi there i know i should post something up but am not quite sure what to say
post post blah blah blah
so a quick recap 1
just returned from a whirlwind tour of bangkok koh samui and home sweet home 2
now back in melbourne freezing in our cold summer weather
overindulged in cny goodies over the past couple of weeks
gained extra kilos coz of said cny goodies
does anyone know how to make more cny goodies 6
just watched honey am inspired once again though not by the stilted acting to shake my tailfeather
thinking of taking dance class so i booty to the beat yo like jessica alba in honey and to lose said cny kilos
thinking of volunteering at local campus radio station to get back into the game
should really stop annoying habit of speaking in quotation marks
also i confess in my mtvfuelled madness while back home i bought in the zone simply because i can and i like her ok
needless to say my friends have disowned me my brothers loathe me and my pet fish and i are no longer on speaking terms
this has by far gotta be the best publicity effort weve seen in a while
babies and celebs whatll they think of next who is that with jeremy
silly songs with sarah im not sure if ive ever shared my wilbur song with anyone via my blog but i thought heck maybe i should entertain people once in awhile
to the tune of copacabana his name was wilbur he was a showpig with that blue ribbon on his snout he was the one that was no doubt he was the winner for all their dinners
bring out the forks and the knives and the plates because dear wilbur
bam bam bam hes christmas ham
how didja like that didja didja didja
thrills and shpiels im surprised my other blog is still around considering i havent updated it in ages enjoy
comparative natures right after i blogged the last post i took it upon myself to visit other bloggers blogs mostly friends from church
boy oh boy have i got a lot of catching up to do especially with this bunch of eloquent peeps we have
and all emerging from the woodork they have a knack of turning the terribly mundane to something far more interesting very much like how my sis does with her blog which btw is still one of my alltime fav
hmm doesnt quite run in the family if you know what i mean
ah wells back to work seeya in a while
hmmm havent blogged for a long time primarily coz ive been caught up with work plus ive been well er lazy
hi my name is sarah and im a lazy blogger

frustration part 2 wouldnt you know it

frustration im so frustrated at the lack of productivity
at the hunger pangs caused by waiting
im meant be at soony and michys for dinner right now yet am stuck waiting for my ride to come whos in turn stuck at a meeting which should have been settled eons ago
the complications of starting a new business

mummy like yr new blog so refreshing so full of life
a trip down memory lane taking my own advice i revisited the posts id written when i first started
i just realised ive been with blogger for almost exactly two whole years now can ya believe it hehehe
reading the trials and tribulations of uni life brought a smile to my lips teehee
and reminded me of the anguish of assignments etc and having my sacre bleau ibook damaged
thankfully azalea my trusty ibook has served me well in the last 3 years
only the batterys shot coz of the overcharging i did to her
basically azalea functions more as a desktop rather than a laptop nowadays
but shes still pretty i think the new look has really inspired me to blogwritejournal again its amazing what a little greenery can do to jumpstart a floundering writing career ok ok
i reeeeeally need to go sleep now
alex my man i hear ya
blogging is highly addictive especially when one should be doing something else
man oh man i really should be preparing for my 1 timothy sessionpresentation at the meeting tomorrow arvo but am hooked on blogging and shifting my template designs around
oh darnit wish i were more disciplined or at least know a little more about html where do i add my tagboard html in this new template father please give me fresh inspiration wisdom and discernment as i tackle the pastoral letters tomorrow this really feels like im back in school tackling lastminute homework
how do ya like it how do u like the new look i like very much
on a serious note itll take awhile to put in the shpiels and tagboard and the links ive had before so bear with me
on the plus side my archives have returned yesh you can now revisit posts of years gone by and see my personal journey in melbourne anyways if u have any comments on the new look let me know leave a comment for the meantime enjoy the scenery
coming soon a new look will arrive
am in the midst of choosing
also herere the rest of the lyrics for wilbur introducing
verse 2 to the tune of copacabana his name was wilbur he was a showpig with that blue ribbon on his snout he was the one that was no doubt he was the winner for all their dinners
bring out the forks and the knives and the plates because dear wilbur
bam bam bam hes christmas ham
hes christmas haaaamm when he was chomped down they were still hungry they needed something added more or they were walking out the door and then came cranberries right for their tummies juicy and sweet they looked great such a treat to go with janice
bam bam bam their pet turkey
stay tuned just wanna let yall know that the next verse of my silly song wilbur has been created in a space of only 15 minutes at mark teos bday dinnerbunch time in between the meal and cakecutting it was a challenge by the fellow bunch members last week pat pat pat on the back haha
have gotten good reviews so far and its even inspired a cabaretstyle performance idea with lifesized props to illustrate the story with ellen philpott and assorted backup singersdancers in shiny costumes bobbing up and down holding top hats and canes very showy but what would you expect from a song to the tune of copacabana imagine
a darkened theatre a solitary spotlight focussed onstage where a lone figure sits on a barstool her head bowed down capped by a black fedora
the tune plays over the sound system and on cue i pop my head up and start singing softly at first then louder and louder and joined in by the bopping chorus behind me while the dancers carry the lifesized illustrations as they prance about on stage as the sounds cultimates to its dramatic climax and
phew gotta get my head outta the clouds
teeheehee how incredibly accurate how to make a sarah ingredients 3 parts competetiveness 5 parts silliness 5 parts beauty method stir together in a glass tumbler with a salted rim
add a little cocktail umbrella and a dash of lustfulness username personality cocktail from goquiz
hellos agains i have so much to get done before the weekdays up especially in terms of the annual dinner that im planning thats coming up
so much to get done and so many people to liaise with
sometimes i wonder if its just easier to not work with people especially when u have to push cajole beg to ask them to get things done
i hate doing it hate being the middleman
i want the vision to inspire people enough that theyre clamouring to get it done to support what were planning but those darn exams just get in the way planning a wedding on the flipside seems to generate much more excitement
most people ar ecstatic to be invited to be part of the intimate undertakings of planning a wedding and i fully understand why its like being a part of a secret sorority that creates something beautiful and onceinalifetime chance and im so terribly honoured and grateful that my friends have jumped at the chance to assist and be a part of something that holds so much meaning to me
i guess i just wish that that sort of excitement could be generated in everything i need help to do is it really how well i have to cast a vision thatll inspire others to move out of their comfort zones sometimes even i dont want to move out of the zone myself to do above and beyond whats just required of me
i mean its not like i needwant others to do the tasks but really the sense of delegationasempowerment
as in teach them how to fish and they can fish for a lifetime that kinda philosophy but of course there are instances where my skills are sorely deprived in departments of creative design graphics and layout and i have to depend on others
as you can tell im ranting
lord i ask for wisdom and strength and calmness in times like these teach me to be more like you less self more you father i need your supreme wisdom patience and kindness to fill my every thought and deed
let me not be so tired that i forget how to see others as images of you
just what are collared greens tonight was spent quite lovely in fact in the presence of like individuals who enjoy the oftentimes eccentric humour shared intrinsically
thats why our bunchs called out of the box
that aside it was pretty fun to revisit the veggietales king george and the duckynot least larrys silly song on barbara manatee
but mostly it was the time spent after that we engaged with the creative side of our minds as we prepared for our songanddance bunch item for the upcoming annual dinner
in the words of bob the tomato have we got a show for you suffice to say were ripping off showtunes and putting our own words in it
theyre songs that kids would appreciate i presume not least for the fact theyre composed by a bunch of adults with very kidlike mentalities
i can imagine the spiel bible characters come to life in this charming stage rendition of stories like youve never heard them before cue spotlight as the cast emerges
there must be some torros in the atmosphere
its officially the start of winter and the chills are setting in
surprisingly though today was still pretty warm
i guess coz its only the 9th day of winter
which also marks the 9th month mark of my term as an intern at accf applause applause todays big question what does it mean to live a life thats adventurously expectant romans 815 msg the resurrection life you received from god is not a timid gravetending life
its adventurously expectant greeting god with a childlike whats next papa i guess for me a life thats lived adventurously is one thats on the edge however cliche that sounds built in faith
expectancy calls for faith calls for living beyond what we can see and often times beyond our means or capabilities
adventurously thats a call to be daring to leave our comfort zones
so today i shall begin like this i adventurously expect
post your adventurous expectancies people in the comments section
hope you dont mind bart
heres what my friend barts been up to lately which i think is ultra ultra cool revamping his ibook qn to bart is the friends image a temporary solution or permanent hope its the former
dissociative identity disorder aka multiple personality disorder aka only by popular usage schizophrenia a word can trigger off many emotions and the consequent turmoil as the mind and spirit tries to grasp one that befits the occasion is
its like playing word association where each phrase conjures up an expanse of images and feelings and heightened senses
these are the words for me aunty yvonne cny angpow chicken wings wedding funeral life support heart lung breath cancer crash distant close love home tim danny adeline daisy telok blangah short hair maternal peace heaven love i wonder if any of these memories are simply confabulations stopgaps to create a sense of connection like im grasping bits of straw that inevitably slip through my weak fingers
i dont know what to feel and id gather most in my situation wouldnt as well
sad yes but yet at times not really
its only when triggers appear or when im not distracted by something else work people church
like im trying every emotion in the spectrum for size to see how it fits
do i grieve yes i guess where the wracking sobs appear inexplicably but not very long each time and anyways just what are the rules for the mourning process so new this is
i wonder if my grandma realises whats happened
and i wonder what that would trigger in her too will she babble and smile and greet familiar faces at the wake not comprehending its significance or worse understand the full painful measure of the loss of a child too many thoughts to ponder
embarking in about an hours time ill be on my way to flinders in the mornington peninsula area for an overnight campretreatintensive with the rest of the community
were going to be equipped in tools teaching and the bonds of friendship this weekend to carry us through the tide and turmoil of an everchanging world
i got a frantic sms from my mum today read it disbelievingly then called her back immediately only to hear the distress in her voice
she sounded like shed be crying and rightly so i suppose
we just found out my closest aunt on my dads side has been declared and i hate this word braindead
like a sufficiently melodramatic phenomena constantly portrayed in a daytime soap opera or channel 8 serial
shes on life support right now and i dont have the full details but suffice to say im shocked
i had no idea this was coming
her cancers been in remission for awhile and id never known that shed been inandout of the hospital over the last couple of months
bringing up her name always conjured up images of love warmth and fantastic food that wed always enjoy at her place during cny
and though we only ever saw each other during my trips home in the lunar new year period weve maintained a certain sense of closeness i feel
id anticipated meeting up sometime during my trip back in december even during cny again if possible or if not at the wedding in april but now
i dont know what i feel
not quite coming to terms
maybe my mums message was wrong
maybe it was a she might be braindead kinda thing mum often leans towards theatrics it run in my family
well just have to wait and see
lull am suddenly filled with the depressive haze that assaults me in periodic moments
after the high from learning and utilising my brain at the rikk watts seminar over the last couple of days coupled with the social performance of maintaining friendships over a meal im suddenly feeling really really for lack of a better word sian
i suddenly feel like im being extremely unproductive
lots to do but its all a blur of tasks that im not quite up to doing
its all the planning i have to do hate sitting at a desk interacting with a voiceless machine and trying to articulate the swim of thoughts and thingsthatneedtobedone in point form
am expected to plan and strategise
but am neither equipped nor have the passion to do so i totally dislike a deskbound job
and theres the praying meeting in an hourandahalfs time which i dont feel like going to yet dont wish to spend my night distracting myself with the meaningless void of watching tv or a movie
its a waste of time which ive always known yet cant seem to tear myself from
hence ive to put my foot down on that one right now
which is why im going for the meeting
altho of course a huge part is so i wont disappoint the people who expect me to be there but if that element serves to stop me from distracting myself with other meaningless objects then so be it
the groans and pains of a growing christian living in the postpostmodern world
grandma i was suddenly reminded of my grandma
of the fraility of life
of the lossness of memory of being a prisoner of self of the fading distance between the conscious mind and the unconscious one
the reminder served to halt all trains of thought and brought great sobbing tears to my eyes
will i see her when i return in december will she live long enough to celebrate my impending marriage will she be there waiting on the front porch smiling through the haze of her cloudy vision i wrote this in response to that reminder im crying at work
mostly due to the feeling of abject horror and loss a total and overwhelming sense of helplessness and guilt
that i cant even give her a hug when i most want to that she has totally recessed from my conscious mind only to turn up as a blip in my radar when her name is mentioned
but yet i understand the passage of life the frailty and fruitlessness of the achievements made in decades past fading as distant drops in the misty horizon
which is why im reminded once again that i cannot live it the way most do climbing clawing attaining and ultimately losing everything
and im cheered and conforted by the fact that shes as much an eternal being as me and you her body and mind will disappear but her soul bouyed by her faith and belief in her saviour will never cease to exist
to the person who reminded me i hope you understand too
not because i seem to know the answer and that this is the only answer but its my source of comfort and strength
food alert am reading a book charles lent to me called eat chocolate drink alcohol and be lean and healthy by andrew jobling
sounds impossible yeah it does to me too
but catchy title aside its pointing out that nutritional dieting may not neccesarily mean a deprivation of all luscious food great and holy
from the glimpses ive had its pointing out how moderation is key understanding how your body works and maintaining a healthy relationship with food to ensure quality life over years
so that means a good balanced meal of protein veggies and yes carbs and fat even hah take that consumer marketing
watching your glycemic intake eating smaller but more frequent meals among other things
so bring on the chockkies just not as much tho on another note am also checking out this supposedly free weightloss programme also touting long term effects by watching calories
oh well well see how it goes
dont worry folks am not planning significant weightloss just wanna tone up and detrain myself from the unhealthy obsession with processed junk food thats not just at maccers but in your local supermarket too sob
am signing up with the arrow gym too can ya believe it target date by yulis wedding in december
every morning when i wake up i think this this is the day that i will go to bed early i hate getting up in the morning
i am so not a morning person that i am the antimorning person
if you talk to me as i am waking i will growl at you even if you are being ever so sweet and tying to gently rouse me
i crave saturdays when there are no waking up deadlines and sleep goes on and on and on
but somehow and micraculously after about 1520 minutes on the weekdays i begin to perk up start making the coffee thank god for coffee and think that maybe i can make it through the day without vertically snoring
i do end up making it through the day but have to fight like hell not to take a nap in the afternoon
the hours between 46 have become my nemisis
the problem revolves around the fact that i stay up til about 1230 or 1 everynight i teach school so this is way late
there is no real reason why i do this
i am not writing a novel or developing photographs or even knitting an amazing sweater
no you can usually catch me doing well nothing i guess
i cant acurately say what i do each night
sometimes im reading sometimes watching tv sometimes reading blogs online and sometimes talking to west coast friends
i used to actually stay up to watch letterman but tv bores me more and more lately
i have always been a night owl
i cant remember when i didnt like staying up late
it must have started in late elmentary school or middle school when i can remember watching saturday night live and johnny carson with my family i know quality bonding time
i remember in college wishing that exams were given at night because my brain was just so much more alert then and i was convinced this would improve my grades
i still wake up at about 8pm everynight
this is when i begin getting things done the dishes the laundry the phone calls the emails the projects the organizing
about 2 hours into my second wind i remember that i wanted to go to bed early so i dont feel like shit in the morning but 10pm rolls around and i think i can give it one more hour and then i think if i go to bed at midnight ill still get about 7 and 12 hours of sleep
sounds good but this never happens
so everynight i stay up doing things that will sadly not bring to me to enlightenment anytime soon
i wish that i could say that i have an extraordinary social life filled with late night gallery openings and wild parties but no
instead ill be washing my hair helping my friends pick the perfect bridesmaids dress online or shutting the world out with a book
tonight i will be um lets see um well how about reading my fabulous travel book on london no im not going anytime soon im just obsessed until midnight
and tomorrow morning when i wake up i will think this this is the day that i will go to bed early
who pray tell designed apartment buildings so that you can hear everything that is happening in the apartment below you with almost complete and utter accuracy i mean is it that hard to place some sound absorbing panels in between the floors as you build think architects think my neighbors downstairs are college students
why they live in our beautiful mostly populated by the elderly and some young professionals far away from the college they attend apartment complex i dont know
and i actually dont know them
i know that one is a boy and one is a girl
i know that the boy plays guitar and sometimes tries to sing along mostly dave matthews songs
i know the girl will occasionally put on some jason mraz
my connections to the above musicians would probably blow their minds but i will never be friends with these college brats and so they will never know
and i know that i can hear the boy cough at times
what does that mean he can hear me do i wonder about this one
tonight they are listening to the radio and they have what i think is a subwoofer cranked up so as i sit here trying to watch tv or listen to my music i just hear deep voices and bass
it blows so being the oh so nice and always ready to lend you some sugar should you be baking something neighbor i turned up my subwoofer to the maximum
take that you slackers i am usually quite kind with my subwoofer
when my brother installed it and put it at maximum i told him i had neighbors below and that it needed to go lower a lot lower
so much for thinking of other people
the reason for this retaliation is that i think that they like to bang their ceiling my floor when they think that i am being loud
ok so i always have some kind of noise on i hate quiet but when i am watching tv and they bang and i check the volume it is on 2 bars
ok people i pay enough in rent to listen to my tv at 2 fucking bars i am not actually sure what the banging is about
i wonder sometimes if it is my imagination
what could 23 poundinglike sounds in rapid succession be one day i came home and as i walked in the door i heard the 2 bangs
i threw my stuff down and yelled at the floor i havent even been here to make noise
what you dont like it when i open my door maybe just maybe there is some phantom mouse running around and driving them crazy while i am constantly monitoring my volume
i cant help but remember the friends episode where the old neighbor below is always banging on his ceiling when the friends are not actually making noise
when he dies and they go to his apartment they hear what sounds like a party going on above them but they are all in his apartment
could this be what is happening in my building i dont know but i always turn down the noise if i hear the banging until of course tonight and the subwoofer wars
richmonds annual chili cookoff held many feasts for my eyes 1 william hung
he was one act among many at the festivities and his one song performance of she bangs was almost worth the 20 admission fee
2 people wearing clothes that should have been retired years ago or never purchased a belly shirts these should only be worn by people who do not actually have bellies and then only when they want other women to hate them
b clothing that is too tight there was a woman who looked normal in everyway except that her tan linen pants were a bit snug above her thighs and by snug i mean she had a permawedgie
c stripper shoes the shoes which i am referring to had a 3 inch clear plastic heel silver souls and clear plastic straps
i know youre jealous again
note to self dont go to the chili cookoff as cant handle the dress requirements
3 people running after beer the beer trucks ran out of beer about an hour before the cookoff ended
we were waiting in line and when they would announce that the beer was gone people would scatter quickly to another truck and so on and so on
note to self dont go to an event where grown people run after silly things unless there is a sale on at saks
4 a womans bare ass as i walked to my car i saw that the passenger door of the car beside me was open blocking my door
there was no one around and as i got closer and closer i looked for someone to tell that i needed to close the door
then as i approached my car i saw that there was in fact someone behind the door a womans bare ass peeing
um ok um um look in the other direction um wait um dont look hope that friend tells her i am here um um
when she is done and is pulling up her pants over her bare ass and says im sorry i just really had to pee say its ok do what you gotta do and quickly get in your car and pull away
note to self never never have to pee that bad
when i checked the mail one day last week and saw the oversized cream envelope with my name and address perfectly printed on it i thought oh hell heres another one
i open it to find an invitation to a cousins wedding in may
as i scan the card for the wedding the reception the directions and the reply card i think and so the season begins
every year there is a flow of weddings in my life
i have probably been to at least 50 weddings since i was small
since college they just keep on coming
someone told me that there is usually a boom right after college and then again in your 30s
um there has been no let up in the bombing apparently the troops refuse to surrender give up and just go home
i do have to say that i sometimes am on the firing squad well in some capacity anyway
this year marks the seventh run as a bridesmaid for me ok so 2 of them were my brothers but still 7 come on people
thats right seventh this does not include the ones in which i will merely be a spectator
i love my friends and family and am so honored to be included in these special days and this is no diss on them in anyway
this is all about me
i mean its always about me anyway right this year are the weddings of 2 very special people my cousin who is like a sister to me and my best friend who basically is a sister to me
these are probably the most special ones that i will be a part of and in my best friends i am the maid of honor
when she asked me i cried and then reality set in this is my 7th time walking down the aisle alone
oh there are no pitty parties anna is an independent
one friend said well at least youre getting closer
i was like um thanks thats as close as i want to be for now anyway
so i do my duties of planning and attending showers giving my measurements to strangers probably the worst part of the whole process and being there for the bride in any way she might need
i do all of this thinking as cinderfuckinrella thanks pretty woman did that someday my prince will come
but oh no dont think he needs to rescue me no
i want a prince for all the other reasons plenty of cash big house private jet
no really i want a prince who is prince of humanity in that he treats me and everyone i love with kindness who is so funny that i laugh out loud just thinking about things he has done or said who wants to learn to do things that i love just because i love them and who wants me to do the same for him
i think my friends and cousin have found these princes i know they have
im just hoping that they havent gotten the last ones
music stations can make you feel like you are stuck on repeat of a mixed cd
the same songs over and over
but then there in the distance on the hour every hour and during rush hour and some good hours on friday night and sunday there is npr to rescue me
i like a pop song just as much as the next person but i dont think that i ever actually will find you in a club with a bottle full of bub but i do know people who have taken prozac which now appears to be causing suicidal tendencies
i heard this tidbit before eyeing it on any other news source that day
i love the idea of multitasking driving and getting abreast of what is or is not going on in the world
i cant watch news on tv anymore unless its bbc and then only when im actually in england because the inane trying to be analytic dribble drabble that procludes from these peoples mouths is too much for me to stand
i tell my father everytime that i am home that foxnews is one of those broadcasts that actually does write its copy for people with an 8th grade education because that is there audience if you didnt know thats suppose to be the industry standard for level of writing 8th grade yeah i know
he just ignores me and continues to be dumbed down
newspapers are fine but i dont have the dough to subscribe to them and reading a newspaper online just doesnt seem right to me
and so when i get in my car and im just sick of hearing the same 4 songs i check the clock and thank god that it is after 4 in the afternoon and there is information to be learned as i drive home
some days i even leave early in the morning so that i can hear the more indepth news as i drive in the closer you get to 9am the more entertaining the pieces get
i mean all things considered i just need a little fresh air to handle this american life
today i heard a school secretary say to a little girl now youre not going to get suspended anymore are you as i passed by the conversation i wanted to say no youre wrong
this little girl wouldnt do something to get suspended
i mean look at her shes cute welldressed calm and polite
and then metacognition set in and i realized that i had just committed a mental act of sexism
our mothers might not understand why this scene might make us step back and take note of our place on the balance of the sexes
my mother didnt even begin college until i her third child was in elementary school
and she is the only one of her sisters to have a college degree
a few years ago she got her masters in administration approximately 1 year before i go my masters hoping to become a school principal
it seems that her age has hindered those hopes sexism replaced by ageism
my mom is older than my friends parents
she has a 39 yearold son after all
im not sure if this is really true but she continued teaching and thanks to bushs unfunded no child left behind she has in fact been left behind
it now appears that she must have in hand a different type of masters to do the same job shes been doing for 3 years
but im sure that 40 years ago she never would have thought shed be worrying about what type of masters degree she had
former generations of women only hoped that women would have as many choices and possibilities that we do now but with the entire world laid out before us what do we really have but more questions what if we just want to be married and have children and thats it
what if we want it that simple is it sacrilege to not take advantage of the choices or is that the whole point anyway i personally would feel no shame in dropping the 50000 dollars and 20 plus years spent on my education to be a happy homemaker
but alas baby making and the perfect spinach quiche are not the path i stumbled onto nor will it be anytime in the near future
after all i have a research project due for my might turn into a phd class
when riding my bike and a slight hill appears i must use all my leg power to tackle the mere incline im not talking real hills
as im peddaling with more and more emphasis i cant help but be aware of my powerhouse legs
my calves are huge and this is not actually related to me being overweight
there are two reasons for my treetrunk legs
first there is genetics i know blame your mother
but seriously ive never seen the women in my family ever really break a sweat sure there is the occasional walking of the dog but no intense exercise going on and yet these women do not have dainty legs
we have legs built for
well i dont know what for
the second reason is linda watkins school of dance
i was a dancer from age 4 to 18 and dancers have powerhouse legs how else could they leap like that i tapped balleted toed and jazzed my way through 14 years of jetes plies and time steps
i usually hated dance class but the recitals i lived for
there is nothing like being on stage and performing
my favorite was the kick line
and still years later when i hear elvis costellos hot hot hot which is not that often i want to throw some eye high kicks and do a split oh there were splits
sadly i couldnt do a split now if you paid me
i miss the way a dancer knows her body how every move is fluid and somehow perfectly calculated even walking can be a dance
our dance instructor used to tell us a story about a dancers grace
the story goes that she was coming home from the grocery store holding a bag of groceries in each hand
when she stepped up her back stairs to her house she slipped on a thin layer of ice
and this is where the grace comes in she would emphasize that because she was dancer she knew how to fall and thus landed safely on the ground legs folded perfectly to soften the full body blow
the strange thing is that i dont remember ever practicing or in fact ever falling in dance class but i understood what she was saying
a dancers right hand always knows and reacts to what the left hand is doing
ive never broken a bone pulled a muscle or torn a ligament could this be due to the dancing i dont know but thanks to linda watkins when im 85 and fall down my front stairs i may not in fact break my hip
i was cruising on my bike through windsor farms today
its a posh neighborhood in richmonds westend where the houses are big and beautiful the yards are kept up by hired hands im sure and all children go to st
christophers cause being educated along ghettofied kids is to much of a reality for these folks
ok so i would like to own a house here but my kids would go to public school damnit
on my bike tour past the beautiful agecroft yes some aristocratic cook had the house torn apart and shipped over here from england but this was a long time ago when ghettofied kids would have been slaves
the house is amazing and has a prescious spot in richmond it rests on a small hill and looks out to a small mountain which has not been tainted with developments
its serene and reminds me of my hometown and of my last home cville
growing up among moutains i hated them
my hometown is in a valley and therefore surrounded on all sides as if the hills protect and keep the people below
and in many ways they did my hometown is a sheltered place
though quaint at times it could possibly be the redneck version of a city upon surrounded by a hill hills
but we all know what happens to utopia oh yeah it doesnt exist
so for most of my life i have cursed the moutains and hills especially when trying to learn how to drive a stick shift i actaully gave up trying for a good year
i didnt start to accept and reclaim them until this past summer in montana
i traveled to montana for a friends wedding and when i stepped off the plane and found myself surrounded by mountains i thought i was back in my hometown except there are no semitall buildings and i dont think they know what urban sprawl is
throughout the weekend i kept thinking what is so great about these moutains ok so they are huge and the ranges are much bigger than virginias and they are bit more pristine but really no virginian would be that amazed as i wasnt
then when drving back to cville from the airport in dc and going up and down the rolling hills i thought these are my hills montana has nothing on these
i think i began to love my state then
im proud to be a virginian which is saying something considering i have always wished to be an north carolinian
richmond has no hills or mountains to look at were too far east
some days as im driving to work i feel like i dont have everything that i need for the day i check everything my watch my purse my coffee and i and cant find the missing piece but maybe its the moutains the blue ridge that im missing without really knowing it
my sisterinlaw had an embroidered pillow which rested on her white loveseat which sat in an area off to the side of her kitchen in her former house
the pillow said in green thread bloom where youre planted and of course had simple colorful flowers sprouting underneath the words
the first time i saw this pillow i thought what a great saying
after 3 eyeopening egoblasting years in a teaching position that drove me to see a therapist a move to a new city a new job and lots of downtime i can now see the sunlight
the cloud which followed me around all my life much like the dust cloud that follows pigpen from charlie brown has lifted
the weather is not always clear it rains and storms still but mostly there are sunny days
ive moved to richmond to start over and when i first moved here i was so excited and thrilled to begin again and to do it right this time
well 6 months into living here i was not happy
the cloud was back my apartment was a shambles and i hated waking up to go to work every morning
i was obsessed with new york city and sad that i could not afford to move there or to london or anywhere
then i began to repeat and reflect on that pillow in my sisterinlaws kitchen
and while im not ready for blooming at least for now i think ill germenate
and im sure with all this sunlight a stem will form
next time ginko trees live 1000 years
eating the leaves will clear you brain
when i heard about them i thought of my mother how much i would like to sit under one with her in the ancient shade nibbling the flesh the stem the central vein
i love the bridges of richmond
they are no architectural triumphs by any means
they are simple and quiet sometimes elegant and to me quite satisfying
my favorite is the nickel bridge
it is a small two lane bridge that is made of intricate iron workings on either side and is lighted by short lamps which are part of the iron work
it is a quaint bridge and one of the quite one i think
as cars pass each other in close proximity its as if they are quitely saying hello to each other
the one i take to work everyday the powhite pkwy is a toll bridge and although i pay everyday and hope that my
50 will soon make enough of a difference that the tolls will soon go away i make sure to enjoy the view on either side of me
on the left is a train bridge that was clearly built when we took time for grandeur and beauty in transportation
the train bridge is grey stone with slender arches that reach just under the flat top
everytime i look at this bridge i imagine riding in a cafe car on a train in the 20s sipping tea and headed south to somewhere fabulous
just visible beyond the train bridge is the nickel bridge much shorter than the train bridge and sometimes i think it is a whisper of a bridge in the distance
back to the right side of the powhit bridge
on the right is only the james river and its tree lined banks
the river is a bit rocky at this point and every morning i can gauge the level of percepitation west of richmond
when the river is at a normal level birds perch on some rocks that barely rest above the water level
the first time i saw i bird sitting on one of these tiny rocks i wondered if he thought himself a daredevil
the hugenot bridge is at the end or beginning of cary st
it extends into the posh westend of richmond
this bridge is two lanes with rails on either side that mimic a picket fince in metalic piping
but its length is what is so fascinating
it goes for at least a quarter mile and part of is not over water at all
when you start the bridge from the cary st
side you enter and curve around into a grove of trees
because its a bridge a this point you feel as if you are suspended through a small forest
as you curve around train tracks appear quickly and then the banks of the of the river
its a bit like a fairytale bridge no exactly magical but unnexpected
the willey memorial bridge mimics the hugenot bridge in length and setting but is far different in description
the bridge is all concrete and lit by standard street lights
the lee memorial bridge is my least favorite
it connets downtown to a area that could be referred to as the projects a sad and large part of this troubled town
this bridge is open to pedestrians on either side so that the blank concrete feel is even more guarded by chain link fencing
although the bridge is wide with four lanes you feel boxed in and cant see the water underneath
the idea and realization of being suspended over rushing water does elevate the drab feel of this bridge for the brief trip over the james
bridge is another nondescript bridge but on the downtown bank there is a memorial to vietnam veterans of virginia
its a beautiful memorial a large stone wall in the background a grand shape of a women inside behind a glass wall
ive havent seen it up close its on my list of things to do
just the other day i discovered an walking suspension bridge under the 2nd st
the walking bridge literally hangs below the towering car bridge above
it reminds me of the millineum bridge in london another beautiful walking suspension bridge
my name is anna and i reside in the old town of richmond va
im a virginian by birth but this my first time living in the capitol city
im a teacher for children with special needs in public schools
i used to teach children with autism which was fascinating
for a long time autism was my passion
at times i still yearn to work with those kids again
im damn good at it but the culture of autism is too abrasive for me
its a complicated long story
i love the kids its just everything that surrounds them and thus henders a teachers effectiveness was too much for me
i like what i do now but not sure if i love it
what does it mean to love a job what does it mean to love anything i just turned 27 with no fanfair and am in the throws of confusion and searching that inhabits all 20somethings
things about me when sex and the city ended i felt like my best friends moved away
i love my nieces and nephew
i love to read pop fiction yes bridget jones is a friend of mine
i used to write poetry fairly seriously in college and worked with some big names
i have a very well decorated apartment its beautiful if i do say so myself
i love to cook and dont do it enough
i need to learn to exercise frequently
i wish that i could take amazing photographs publish some poems book picture dna travel to any city anytime live in nyc live in london etc
do you remember watching music videos i mean really watching them like for hours
my brother and i along with some neighborhood kids at times would sneak snippets of mtv
we were banned from such filth as kids though we seemed to watch endless amounts of it our parents not as quick as they were prudish
i was enamored with george michael
funny he never seemed gay to me at age 10 but then again i didnt know what gay was then either
he was the perfection of hotness to me and that song careless whisper where he crones after a lover lost and that stubble whew that stubble
these days hes not so hot and i wonder why i never saw the obvious batting for the other team going on but again this was the 80s i dont think he was letting many people in on his secrets lest he lose album sales
a few months ago i was flipping through the channels and found fuse a music video channel here in richmond where all they do is play videos
some flashy hiphop song was on and i paused filling the commercial time during another program and actually watched a whole video
i felt like i was 12 again the volume turned down the den door closed and my finger on the remote ready to switch channels should the door open and my mother walk in
i havent watched another video since that fuse moment months ago
i miss the old videos where the stories were weak if anything the bands were overly made up and the women had clothes on
the current generation has no idea what endless mindless hours of music videos are like
they think mtv was created to expose the unreality of 1823 lives
the teeny boppers today wont have slumber parties and stay up late to see how many times their favorite videos appear
theyre lucky if they see their favorite video once during the terribly drab trl
and what happened to a music video doing magic for the unknown artists the one hit wonders of the 80s would be nowhere without their videos
remember divo and the whips my brothers band made a video a few years ago
and if you blinked you missed it
it did nothing for them because kids dont watch videos anymore they want the non reality shows or the watered down overproduced uncreative pop star in their mist and they only want the 10 best knows videos of the day
or at least this is what mtv thinks they want
mtv has gone from groundbreaking to heartbreaking
and vh1 dont even let me go there
and its sad to realize that i am no longer the target audience of mtv
they dont care about my demographic anymore even though i busted my butt sneaking hours of videos into my childhood
sorry dire straits you can have your money for nothin
it turns out i dont want my mtv
i was playing with my 3 yearold niece today when she said im the king of the castle
then pointed to me and said youre the dirty rascal
and i was immediately placed inside the melody of crash
i was irrovacably sadden that my childhood is now wrapped inside the lyrics of a dave matthews song
then later in the backyard waiting for the hotdogs on the grill i heard a bright highpicthed song lingering in the air
i knew immediately that it was an ice cream truck
whew how long has it been since ive seen on one of those
oh the days of yore
i dont bite and i like to hear from the people i love in my life
really id like to hear from you
if you stop by tell me so
ask my friends theyll tell you im funny
its my thing my party trick
i come from a long line of funny people
no none of them are famous
were funny the way your family is funny
the way you take family or friendly information and turn it around spin it on its head give it a sarcastic tone or link it to a historical travesty and spit it back into the air
my relatives have dry and sarcastic oneliners down to a science
its like a racket ball game when we are gathered together
the puns and witty observations fly so fast youre not sure you can hurl them back but then you do you always do
and so i find friends who can play this game who can come together in one accord on making fun of the world and each other
friday night sitting amongst a group of coworkers for happy hour i was anything but happy
oh i was jovial and jokey and witty and brilliant but somewhere along the line i realized that this wasnt the real funny me
i had to work hard that night to tone my references down and to pull what little information i knew about these people to the front of my brain
ive only worked with them for 6 months and this is only the third large group social thing weve done
there is a few staff i know really well and with them i can joke all day there is enough reference material there but when you stick me with a large group of people i only see in the hallways i cant do much
my jokes on friday landed on unfertile ground
there were some hits but mostly misses
when you dont know the people well youre jokes and puns and one liners have to come from outside the group i usually choose current events historical events local events world events ok so anything really
but im sad to say i dont think my audience understood my references
there was a discussion of a painting in the mexican restaurant which was of a man holding his own head
i said i thought it was john the baptist and then asked whose name was signed
i stated again that i was pretty sure it was john the baptist
a coworker said is it a religious thing um i thought i give up
then there was my selfdeprecating comment when another coworker asked if i had gone to vcu with him that i looked like someone in his ethics class
i stated that i had no ethics so no i didnt go to vcu
he didnt bowl over with laughter
whats wrong with you i thought and then realized i dont really know these people
sometimes i dont want to spend all that time it takes to get to know people i just want it to be immediate
my cousins wife was telling me about a dinner party she and 5 other women have every month
they get together and discuss politics by having various members research topics then they come together to discuss
she said she thought of me and that this is something right up my alley
well after tonight and the failed attempts at garnering some sort of recognition for my brilliant repartee i think she is right
i need some good conversation i need some deep thinking i some cognitive stimulation
i went to carytown today with my brothers little family
my 6 yearold nephews artwork was being displayed in a window of a store there part of a citywide school art project
he was 1 of 2 children chosen from his 1st grade class to be placed for all the passersby to see
it was a great picture full of blue and red and purple and white and yellow
there was clearly a sky with clouds and then there are 2 distinct sections on the bottom
one blue square section takes up the majority of the picture with two building shaped things inside
to the right of the large blue square is a skinny blue rectangle with an american flag in it just hanging out
i asked the little artiste what exactly he had painted and he shrugged
his grandmother said it was a house and then i asked well is it a house that you thought up in your mind or a particular house he said he just thought it up
all right well good picture little boy
i then began talking and playing with the little nieces when the artistes mom states that the two buildings are our house and annies apartment building
i turned my body and swung my head around what my apartment building to which the little one said yeah in his sweet wellwhatelsecoulditbe voice
i looked at the picture again and there it was in all the many colors
it was clearly a small onestory house sitting beside a 3story brick apartment building
how did i not see it before i said well look at that im famous
and then the love swept over me
when a 6 year old paints your apartment building into a picture that is love real love
thank you my little ababy
i believe that dogearing pages in a book is sacreligious
i think i may have engaged in this practice when i was 12 for a day or two but it never stuck
it seemed too finite a thing to do
reading a book is a fluid thing
though you stop put it down go on about your life and come back to it the story is fluid or should be
so to me dogearing the pages is like telling the pages even the words to stop going stop moving because the crease is always there
it stands as an acknowledgement that someone paused this scene stopped the monologue or took a break between chapters
it will take days of hard pressing to reduce the dogeared indentation
for me the damage is permanent
literal and literary disrespect has occurred something a book can never shake off
so i use anything i can get my hands on to save my places
i have bookmarks but they never seem to find their way into the books
in bookstore checkout lines i see pretty little bookmarks with clichd phrases and artsy black and white pictures and salivate
but my pavlovian reflexes are always pushed aside because i know that the 3 bookmark will sit in a drawer or beside a stack of books and never actually make it into one
there is no real reason for this
when i need to hold my place i franticly search for something flat or something related to the process of reading
beside my bed there are a number of books held by varying objects
the most frequently read book has my glasses holding court the short story book that i dip in and out of is splayed open side down on a table a book of memoirs is conversing with my itty bitty book light a travel book on london is held in place with the thin red satin ribbon attached to it and another short story book has the receipt for itself tucked inside
the receipt is my favorite placeholder
i think this is partly sentimental in that every time i open the book i look at it and remember the store and the circumstances for the purchase
partly im sure i do this to subconsciously remind myself to get every bit of escapism and pleasure out of the 10
95 i spent on the paperback edition
and partly because its convenient and perfect
a receipt takes up no space between the pages it doesnt ask you to clip it on it just slides right in like it was meant to be there and it never leaves a mark
its the answer to the damaging dogear
its the lazy womans pause button
its quite possibly the very best unbookmark
yesterday i was digging through my assortment of notyetread books and discovered an odd bookmark tucked inside carson mccullers the heart is a lonely hunter
im sure at the time my former therapists business appointment card was the closest thing around when i stopped reading
i cant imagine that i just randomly put this card in this book
it was slipped between pages 4 and 5
a bookmark placed so early in a book would make me think that i never really began reading it
maybe i went for a teaser from the first couple of pages
i have a terrible habit of beginning books and then about 2050 pages into it i pick up another book see the bedside assortment listed above
this is one of my worst habits and one i really hate
commitment phobia rears its ugly head in some many places in my life
i just cant help but think there is a small or rather quite large message in that card in that book
i have seasoned chicken in the oven right now
the smell is amazing and began wafting from the kitchen about 10 minutes after i put it in the 350 box
the smell is of earthy paprika pungent garlic and sweet basil
it smells like home like a weekday dinnertime when a familys house is quiet after a day of harried activities and mouths are watering
my father gave me this container which describes its contents as the worlds best chicken rub
he bought it at food lion a place i never go because ukrops has spoiled me and i am ok with the overpriced ingredients for my cooking or lack there of
i dont even know where a food lion is around here
im sure ive passed one on my travels trough town but i couldnt tell you where
the seasoning gift was unexpected and handed to me in the food lion bag with the receipt still inside
two containers where purchased one for me and for my brothers family
i think i was the afterthought but my dear sweet dad didnt want to leave me out
the seasoning is described as a rub and the directions tell you to brush the seasoning mixed with oil and lemon juice over the chicken
in my kitchen the brush consists of a plastic bag and there is no lemon juice
a poor single girls kitchen is usually devoid of fancy cookery i
i actually do own a cooking brush however i believe i bought it at the dollar store and then only in the hopes that i would someday make delicate puff pastries brushed with butter
i have made none so far
the brush did make an appearance two weeks ago on easter weekend when my visiting mother sort of decided i would cook a ham for the family on saturday night
i didnt know until i was cooking it that this would be my job
ive never cooked a ham before
luckily storebought spiral sliced hams are precooked you just have to know how to heat them up and glaze them
the glazing scared me and when i asked my mom how to do this she simply said brown sugar and mustard
ok i thought but how the hell much of either one i couldnt ask her again she was busy with my little nieces and there was an air of have you learned nothing from me in her voice
i looked in the cupboard and found a clump of petrified brown sugar and of course there is always mustard in the fridge
i remembered that brown sugar comes back to life with heat so i set the stove to high flame put the brown sugar and a splash of water in a small pot squirted about 6 seconds worth of mustard and stirred
the resulting taste test was good it tasted familiar like sweet easter ham
two hours into the ham warmup i pulled it out and brushed on my brown sugary mixture
the glaze was perfect sweet and tart and just right for a first time try
my parents let me keep the leftovers because im poor and because they live 3 hours away
i said thanks that id eat on it all week
i didnt touch it after they left despite my glaze of glory
the first few months i lived on my own with no dining hall or catering company to feed me college dorms and sorority respectively i bought more food than 3 people could eat in 2 months almost each week
i researched and concocted difficult recipes from martha stewart and junior league cookbooks
i even spent 3 hours on a fancy dinner for a going away party for a friend once
ive since learned that friends will come over for your grilled cheese as much for your whole roasted chicken with goat cheese and sage
now ive settled into the typical single girls fridge
i have a door full of condiments waiting for a salad or bread and meat or even fries but i have none of those things actually in the fridge to put them upon
in college my fridge was stocked for weekends and nights i just didnt want to leave the apartment to go eat with my sisters
one roommate and i would try to make what we thought were balanced meals
we would go grocery shopping and come home to heat up canned beans boil a bag of rice and bake chicken with rosemary in tinfoil for 45 mins
we thought our moms would be proud
we also bought an entire red velvet cake once and after 2 days gave up the polite slicing and plating to simply spear it with a fork as we stood at the kitchen counter in our pajamas and bare feet and chatted about how we had really sunk to a new low
during the day today i had a brilliant thought of going to the store after work to pick up a fresh lemon to squeeze in the bag with the chicken and over some freshly cooked rice
i never made it to the store and the poor herbed chicken has no side dishes no friends to share the stomach with
a single girl just doesnt have the time or the energy really for all the fuss and especially all those dishes
there will probably be no leftovers either what with the 1 piece of chicken i fixed my fridge will go another day or 10 with not much more than fancy mustard and light italian dressing
but right now my dinners calling me
miraculously my blessed computer is now typing
i have no idea why it decided to go bananas and turn the letters hjkl andm into 1234 and 5
i took it to school today and i think maybe my baby didnt like being away from home
i wasnt that upset as my computer has been showing signs of trouble for a few months and i expect that everyday may be its last day
i have an order to send it in to apple but am terrified that they will wipe out the memory and start over with all the programs
this makes me want to run away with my sweet sick computer and try to nurse it back to health
but i know i cant do that
so ill have to work on saving all my things like my music and documents and pictures
this is not that hard just dump it on a disc but i have a habit of rereading things and going through everything and reminiscing
what should take me about 23 hours will probably take me 23 days
im just sentimental like that
my laptop is my baby
in fact thats its name my baby
in the upper right hand corner of my macintosh g4 titanium is a tiny replica of my hard drive and the words my baby underneath
my laptop is one of my best friends
not like oh i cant wait to go home and type on my computer
and no im not a computer nerd
i use it for writing and internet and well music and pictures and to watch movies and a to play a game for about an hour every 6 months or so
its like a best friend who enjoys a good flick listens to my favorite tunes and doesnt disagree with my neurotic banter and travels with me almost everywhere i go
this current computer is 2 years old but is still fabulous
when i bought my g4 my older g3 was only 2 years old and one of my brothers thought that i was crazy to buy another one and asked which one i liked better
i stated that it was like choosing between two children it was like sophies choice the apple macintosh version
if you like macs then you love them
there are few mac people who could go either way pc or mac
i am quite obsessed with my macs
ive had 3 so far and used pretty much every version they have come out with
they are beautiful efficient and easy to use machines
this is the first time i have ever had enough trouble with one that the friendly techies on the apple help line couldnt solve
this is the first time they have asked for me to hand over my baby
im scared but today with the typing fiasco i came to terms with having to let go for bit and let the experts do their thing
then i realized that my g3 was still available
i couldnt wait to get home and dig it out to feel the tall black keys under my fingers
pressing them is like pressing down on soft dough
it makes writing fluid and effortless
when i opened the black chunky laptop i ran my hands over its edges
the design team at apple gave the g3 powerbook curves like a woman
the edges are smooth and shapely the sides of the computer make subtle s shapes
its high fashion computer style
i miss the friendly rainbow apple at the base of the screen
it goes to show that apple did not make a big enough impact on the world market to claim the rainbow apple without bringing along the rainbow symbol and all of its stereotypes
apple now goes for a sleek monocolored often white or grey apple a more stylish replacement to its colorful twin
the rest of my g3 is simple and elegant
there are no extra buttons to go straight to the internet open youre email or anything else that junks up a pc keyboard
there could be key functions that did those things for me of course but i get to decide apple does not predetermine my preferences
i think the thing i love most about apple is the companys adherence and strive for simplicity
their computers have clean lines and their mice have one button not five
a simple gift that is was apple has given us in its computers
pc people think that we mac people are strange
the whole world is windows and you are using a mac
you poor deluded youth someone once told me
i told him he better step back and then began my rant on why macs reign supreme
i was showing someone a keying shortcut on a mac like open apple and s for save and explaining the ease and simplicity of macs and she said oh they got those shortcuts from windows
i said no you didnt and then explained how bill gates just made a pc version of the perfected mac interface because people were sick of having to remember which drive to boot up and save on
my cousin says she would rather go without a computer than own a pc which is what she is currently doing
she gets her mac on at work
its a far better place at the top of world my friends
come to the land of milk and apples we are a friendly simpleminded and visionary bunch
as you sulk at us that almost every piece of music or visual media you hear or see has been touched by apple
anna is ok with being in love with her computer
my computer is on the blitz
when i went to type today this is what i got 2230234550300 and that was just hitting random letter keys
have to send it off
im scared they will erase its memory and leave me with a shell of a computer and i will have to start all over
but i cant exactly do anything on it unless i develop a code language using 01234 and 5
but who has time for that
yesterday i stopped by my nephews soccer practice just to say hi and show him how much i love him
he loves to show off but he also gets frustrated with not being perfect when he kicks the ball
he has a lot of perfectionist disappointments ahead of him
while i was there a mother of another child came up to talk to my sisterinlaw
she was asking who was the mother of whom and i said i was just an aunt
she stated how nice it was that i came out to see my nephew
during school yesterday a teacher was telling me about a girl who was behaving badly there is a long story about how bad this teacher is and how she creates the behavior problems in her classroom but that is for another day
the teacher was talking about the girl and how she lives with her aunt because her own mother is in jail
the teacher was trying to point out to the girl that she needed to straighten up because he aunt was good to her even though money was tight in her house
i hear these stories all the time an aunt or a grandmother or even a great aunt taking custody kids in their families
for some reason yesterday it hit me that this is wonderful and strange at the same time
another little boy told me a few weeks ago with a smile on his face that his daddy was out of jail
this was a follow up to the statement my daddy in jail that preceded a few weeks before
i often dont know how to react to these statements and they are frequent
richmond is a troubled town
the murder rate here evens out to about 10 murders a month
that is unbelievable to me
crime is so prevalent that it isnt even a frequent topic of conversation
the newscasters announce the death tolls almost nightly but my friends and i dont worry because most murders are gang or drug related
this makes us feel safer but should it ive become desensitized to so much in this town
im not shocked when teachers or kids tell me about people going into or getting out of jail or prison and im not surprised by bodies being found behind school buildings or churches being burned down
i cant help but think that most of my feelings about family members taking on the responsibility of other family members is cultural
yesterday though i realized when that mother at the soccer field was so impressed that an aunt came out to a soccer practice that im so thankful that my nieces and nephew dont live with me
i cant imagine taking custody of these kids because my brother was in jail i would of course but i cant imagine it
i just cant even fathom it for my family and yet when a child tells me something like this i dont even flinch
it seems so normal in the schools i teach in
i realized yesterday that my desensitization is a bad thing
it causes complacency and this will never help a child
but what can i say for kindergartener whose role models are in jail that will stay with him and keep him off the streets when he grows up
this is a quote from a graduate of my college from my graduating year i am about to finish up two year of mba education at the wharton school and will start work in september at mckinsey co in their brussels office
between graduation and starting work i plan to bicycle across the usa in 48 days
our five year reunion is this summer and some people have chosen to update all those who are waiting with bated breath to see what they have been up to over that last five years
the above update caught my eye because really as if the wharton school wasnt enough this guy had to throw in his hot job in brussels and then of course the side note about the cyclying across the usa but that wasnt enough no then he had to add that hell do it in 48 days
sometimes i wish i had gone to a podunk small town college where i would send in updates like i just consolidated my debt and hope to be out of my misery is 5 to 10 years
and my podunk fellow classmates would think wow i really wish my life were as on track as hers
i really need to reassess my life and get my goals straight
ok well anyway ive got to run
my bicycle needs to ridden around the block in 48 minutes
yesterday bunny day i was driving out to my sisterinlaws parents house for easter dinner yeah were all close like that and noticed store after store closed
her parents live in the suburbs
sorry i just puked and there is mega store juxtaposed to mega store juxtaposed to posh mall along the way to their house
this is how it went down inside my head hmm
why is best buy closed what time is it its only 4pm
but best buy is corrupt and charges restocking fees
why are they all of a sudden holy more like best butt to me
ok there are no cars in front of world market home depot ah kroger there you go guys sell those hams
what the mcdonalds you mean i cant go get a big mac cause the easter bunny is busy
good dear sweet heathen walmart
damn rednecks like to shop on easter that parking lot is full
is sam walton rolling over in his grave nordstrom good for you
you show them how to fear god close you store
um i guess ive never been out on easter sunday to realize that we still observe this holiday by barring heathens from their purchases
i guess i am now a heathen
well good really i dont believe in judging people for their religious beliefs anyway so um a heathen i may be but i still hang out with nonheathens and other heathens and i love them all
i think it says a good deal about a company to close on a religious holiday in this country being that the majority of corporations seem to pray to the god of the u
mint rather than the almighty
i didnt even go to church yesterday
this is the first easter that i havent been to church
i just wasnt down with going to mass with the rest of my family the only catholic is my sisterinlaw cause they dont think im christian enough to drink their wine catholics do it right there is no grape juice up in their joints
so i slept and joined the fam
for the important part the food
ok so this is all blasphemous of me to say
but i probably would have gone shopping yesterday being none the wiser
i had no idea we were that pious a nation what with blue laws being banished within the last 20 years
alright well you go people stand up for something except of course kroger and walmart you guys keep selling on major holidays cause you never know i might need to buy some ice or a fishing pole at the last minute
this past week was my spring break from school and i spent most of it tidying up loose ends and looking for a condo not successfully
all in all not an exciting week considering that this time last year i was getting over my jet lag from london
last year that i had a longing to revisit my favorite city in all the world
after my first tiring and horrendous year of teaching i was planning on going backpacking through europe with a girlfriend of mine but she backed out
then i thought i would spend a summer in london as a reward for getting through the fire but i failed to ever find out how to rent a flat for a reasonable fee for a few months
so two years later after 911 and with a pending war in iraq i decided that i would go to london by myself
there is a time when you realize waiting around for other people isnt worth it
luckily british airways had cheap tickets and aaa travel helped secure a great cheap hotel and off i went
my family was not pleased at all
my brothers were convinced i would be blown up mid flight my mother thought i would be killed on the streets but i and my therapist thought why live in fear i almost backed out though because at the time the war in iraq was only a month old and i did get scared
but i knew i had to get through the bit of fear for many reasons
so here is what got my on the plane i thought sure i can stay here and be safe and not take the risk and it will drive me crazy because the plane on which i have a reservation will be flying with or without me so i can be on it and be in london or sit here for a week and wish that i had gotten on it because after all the worrying it didnt blow up
so i got on the plane and i loved every minute of it
it was wonderful and fabulous and there are not enough cliched things to say
i saw 4 west end shows and revisited my favorite spots and went to museums and shopped and loved it
a good many people think that it was ballsy of me to go and to go alone
ive never had that feeling about that trip
my parents instilled great traveling skills in me and traveling just feels like breathing sometimes
i love it and i must do it
i think i am my best self when i am traveling
i dont stress about what the day will bring or getting through an itinerary because the best things happen when you dont plan
there are too many stories to back up that statement but the places and cities at the moment should be the tour guides not a piece of paper or a set schedule
i missed the traveling this break
i had planned to treat richmond as if i were a tourist this week and go to the historical places and museums that ive been meaning to go to but the week slipped away from me and now i have a paper due
sometimes the real world is not quite a nice as the magical mystical travel filled one inside my head
oh well there are always books to take me there
im currently and just now reading can you keep a secret by sophie kinsella a british novelist
i bought the book last year in harrods of all places because i knew that it was not in the us yet and i enjoy her books
they are the mindless chick lit type that a girl just needs sometimes dont worry i also bought some seamus heaney
so i hadnt read it until now because ive been trying to read a little more highbrow though not much more maybe just a brow lift
so i got it out the other night and read a few chapters each day
then in bn the other day i saw it is out in hardback as a new release
funny how its not new to me at all and yet it is new now
last year i took kinsellas book shopoholic ties the knot to london as i had just begun to read it before the trip
its about a girl who loves to shop obviously who is british but lives in nyc but goes back to england to get married again obvious
i would take it on the tube to read between stops because i also feel that when traveling you dont need to always act like a tourist do what the locals do read on the tube
so i was on the circle line train going to leicester square by way of embankment reading and reading and being nonchalant
the funny thing is that i was reading about the main character visiting her friend in london and going out for tea in sloane square when the train stopped and the doors opened and i heard the announcement of sloane square station
sometimes the universe just aligns
and no i dont believe in that crap but sometimes
sloane square and sloane square meet and i just cant compete
and by the devil i mean uncle sam
i now have to sell my soul and get a second job
turns out i do owe taxes see 432004 post
i went back today to pick up the papers that had been sent to the processing center and there it was in black and white tiny type you owe arrow a shitload
the reason why i owe in the first place is because i tutored some kids with autism last year
and being the honest taxpayer that i am i reported all income and expenses and now i owe
honesty sometimes not the best policy for my ireallywanttogoshoppingbutnowihavetogetanotherjob self
o where o where has my little life gone over the hill to do you need any help or are you just looking im thinking barnes and noble again
ok so most of me wishes that small independent bookshops were the norm rather than giant corporate monsters but when i walk in there and there are a million books on any subject and the starbucks and the prettiness oh the prettiness of it all
i have to work there not because i love it but because i have to to pay the damn taxes and thereby accrue more taxes and then next year get another job and oh god will the cycle ever end fraid not
i hate it when i settle into a quiet night of phone calls to my friends and not one of my dear friends is home
there is nothing like a warmhearted answering machine to make a girl feel loved
i mean my friends are fabulous
they are kind and funny and fun and far away
distance from my good friends hurts sometimes and so when i call them out of an act of loneliness and they are not at home the loneliness gets deeper
their fabulousness outshines my fabulousness to nothing and i go back to what i was doing before the desperate plea for conversation
tonight i got 6 messages and 1 number out of service
the latter was a friend of a friend that ive been meaning to have over for dinner but come on people
then i think about why i wanted to talk anyway
so much of the time i am just ranting on in my neurotic selfobsessed way and what is in it for them i hope that i am a good friend but i know that have my bad moments
one particular friend is excellent at getting me to divulge more and more information
she is a question asker and she is a lawyer
she asks for more and more info
to the point that i have to stop myself and say ok so whats up with you about 45 mins
she is great but she also feeds my selfobsession
shes also taught me the act the listening because she does it so well
then there is my best friend whos mother is a school counselor need i say more
while she herself doesnt have a degree in counseling shes actually a science nerd you know i love you pk she is fabulous at her second job
and she does this for all her friends
in fact she is so good she just may pick friends based on their level of neediness
hmmmmm the immediate lonliness was brought on by my rewatching of my sex and the city dvds
i just really miss my girlfriends sometimes
i miss the closeness that women can have in true friendships when you live in close proximity
my best friend lives across the country and my other dear friends live 224 driving hours away
oh the mark of having successful adventurous independent women friends so i sit down and write and try to work out whatever brought me to the phone in the first place
i think about what my friends are doing right now that takes them away from their phones
are they out with other friends are they watching a movie are they discussing recently read books are they organizing fundraisers are they laughing are they happy i hope they are laughing
i hope they are happy
they are my friends and i love them
on monday i started the possibility of the process of buying my own place
i just met with a realtor thats all no papersigning going on no commitments yet
its a scary thing this idea of home ownership signing away your life for 30 years
its a good idea financially but mentally is this good for me i have a few single girlfriends who have bought places
two friends in richmond bought houses
i think they have balls
not that home ownership is that big of a deal but a house is a big deal
i personally cant go that big
the mowing the pruning roof replacement window washing its too much
i can barely handle keeping my 6room apartment in orderly shape
i can just imagine the letters from neighbors that i would get concerning the jungle that would certainly grow outside my home
so a condo a condo sounds good to me
its like an apartment but id get to paint the walls and a tax deduction
while im still in the beginning stages ive already seen 3 in person and a bunch online
nothing has caught my eye
i think i am waiting for the perfect one to just fall into my lap
ive told my realtor that im interested in city properties and no new construction
i want an old lived in worn and wise place
my very nice my age trying to sell me a place realtor took notes
i checked for a ring
what does it say about me when the men i am not attracted to are married does that mean that somewhere out there there is someone who would love my winning personality and bright smile oh this is not blog about me wanting a relationship
this is a blog about me wanting something a little more of myself i guess
there are friends who say you will find him when you least expect it
a good friend who is getting married this summer tells every single girl who claims they are ok with being single that they should watch what they say because she felt the same way last year and poof shes getting married
well with my relationship phobias i havent been expecting it for um 27 years so um where is the unexpected ok im still not ready for all that commitment so am i ready to commit to a condo we will surely see
there is the old cliche that music can change your mood in an instant
oftentimes i am the cliche
driving in my car a song on the radio will put in the mood for shopping reading a book or dancing within the span of 8 minutes
the emotional hills and valleys that i go through listening to music come up as quickly as the mileposts on the highway
on saturdays when there is work to be done in my apartment i open the blinds or windows turn up the radio on an upbeat usually hip hop station and get busy
choosing one cd to listen during one period of productive time is more difficult
i have a habit of listening to an album until it is worn out and tired
i get a new album and listen to it over and over
ive been known to put certain songs or even the whole cd on repeat for hours
because of this i know every word to albums of bands like u2 sarah mclachlan james harry connick jr
billy brag and wilco michelle shocked david wilcox jimmy buffet and show tunes like les mis and phantom
so much useless information floating around my brain taking up space for real knowledge like whom all of my government representatives are and how they vote in their various arenas
i know that this mind hoarding of information happens to everybody to some degree but not only do lyrics hide in my longterm memory but with those lyrics and melodies are visual olfactory and textural memories
songs and especially whole albums can bring back days events and sometimeswhole years
like james laid cd evokes the memory or camp morehead where i was a nonsailing counselor for one summer in high school
i had brought the only cd player for the cabin so i forced the 1213 year old girls to listen to my brooding british music
camp morehead was dismantled a few years ago and the land sold to people building their dream second homes on the shores of many peoples childhood summers
i actually hated camp but every once in a while when i listen to laid i wish for the slow breeze coming off the bogue sound and all the little sunfish sailing in the wind
there is another cd in my collection that i bought in the dominican republic on spring break my last year in college
a resident of the house my friend and i stayed in played a native dominicans cd everyday so it became the soundtrack to our visit
the music is poorly produced and there are barking dogs used as part of the beat on one song but that cd is probably the best souvenir ive ever gotten from a trip
sometimes in summer ill put it on in my car roll all the windows down and just drive thinking of the dominican
there are many more cds and even more recollections
and so all these memories attached to my music cause the choosing of music to listen to at a particular time quite difficult
there are rows and rows of cds in my collection that i just cant bring myself to play because friends and trips and times in my life are gone and cant be reclaimed
nostalgia is sad state for me and one i only visit when i really miss someone or someplace
and im so thankful when sometimes somehow with new places and good friends i have the opportunity to attach new memories to the music
that all the world should be taxed
and so i went to a local tax place that was giving free tax service to teachers gotta love those perks
it took two nights because i had to wait the first night for another customer
as i waited an older man who is a retired accountant and whos son owns the business began to organize my papers
he was friendly and we talked for at least an hour
of course he knew a lot about me because my life was displayed in numbers before him but he also told me about his exwife who left him six months ago and all the improvements he had personally done on his house that he is now trying to sell
while he was very kind and a great listener this was all too much information but i listened and nodded because he was helping me with finances
when i left the first night after getting some of my information entered i owed a boatload of taxes
i was not happy and immediately began thinking of second jobs
barnes and noble has been on my list for a while but do i really want to work for a corporate monster at the lowest level ok im a teacher i really dont have much of a choice
the next night was more promising well financially at least
when i walked in the older man welcomed me and asked some more questions about my paperwork and then said he found a mistake the previous person had made that would save my taxes and actually grant me a return a small one but at least it was on the positive side
the clouds lifted and i would not have to sell my soul to pay my taxes
he was quite pleased with himself as well and mentioned that he liked to see me smile more than three times
i obliged him the smiles because he was of course saving my taxpaying ass
this was a small outfit so all paperwork would be sent to a processing center to be checked and then i would have to come back to pick it up
when i was ready to leave i went to shake his hand
he held my hand well after the thankyouforyourhelp handshake and said the good news is that i get to see you one more time
i gave a quietidontknowwhatthatmeans giggle and turned and walked out
as i left the store a scary thought went through my head did that old man just hit on me he is not grandfather really sweet older
hes the just retired wife just left me older
i then began to think back to the conversations we had had over the past two nights
did he think there was more than accountant taxpayer information being past i have come to realize that i am clueless to mens flirting techniques even when they are obvious
this usually happens when there is no interest on my part and therefore why would i be looking for signs there was once the college friend who all of sudden told me he loved me
i stopped being friends with him pronto i know im a bitch but he ended up gay so um i think i was right
there was a guy at a bar once who told me he had been staring at me and trying to pick me up for 12 hour
i had no idea and im glad actually he ended being quite cute and ohso strange
then there was a guy at weekend long party who followed me around the whole first night until i realized after he told me that i was the kind of girl he wanted to marry that i really needed to just be around my girlfriends
i hate those clueless girls the ones who have guys swarming around them while they are supposedly oblivious
i guess sometimes we all are that girl
regardless if the old taxman was getting flirty or not i cant help but feel that my tax refund is now just dirty money
heres me trying to add linky links in the text for the first time
buy an apple it will save your life good news good tv better tv the best music ok im done with the practicing
have fun with the linking
so the other day i was flipping through my sitemeter stats and noticed that someone came to my blog through google
i clicked on the link to see what subject they entered to get here
i like to see what other sites pop up along with mine
well some perv entered pee together into the google search engine
my site came up becuase of my innocent story about my cousin and i when we were little
i was totally grossed out
i just need a hug
no no the biggest hug you have actually
a giant teddy bear sized hug that envelopes me and cradles me and maybe even rocks me gently back and fourth
a big hug thats all
well and maybe the answer to the question of why
the work dork refers to the male sexual organ geek was the name of a circus performer who bit the head off of chickens and jerk refers to the jerking motions that a person with severe cognitive or physical disabilities can display when they lose control of their muscles
sometimes the words in our verbal lexicon are no so innocent
i gotta go i squealed
i was 4 years old skinny with dark hair pale skin and big brown eyes
i gotta go too said b
she was 5 years old skinny with blond hair and brown eyes
we were beautiful together the little girl version of yin and yang
lets go together one of us said
so we raced to the upstairs bathroom got ready and sat down together to pee
we were peeing together our tiny bottoms sharing one toilet
our mothers thought it was precious
this was our cousin thing a little girl bonding time
one mother grabbed a camera and flashed our picture b
with her long blond hair and legs together facing the bathtub me with my long brown hair and legs together facing the wall
we are squeezed in our hands holding on to the tips of the oval seat so we wouldnt fall in or off
our clothes are simple knits me in white b
in dark blue our shorts stuck to our legs have appliqu
it is one of my favorite pictures b
and i concocting a simple plan to kill two birds with one stone
im so glad there is a picture of that innocent time
and i will talk about our childhoods how we grew up so differently yet share so much in common
she is my blond size 2 cousin
she is a modified hippie
i am an exsorority girl
her mom is young and the least neurotic of her sisters
but we both have a factor in our blood that causes blood clots
we are so different and so similar
i am proud of her that she is a brilliant photographer
i love that she loves her animals and plants like they are her children
im glad she has found a man in a fairytale way which we always dreamed would happen
i love that she is strong and kind and knows more than she tells
and i love that sometimes she will say with laughter in her voice anna we use to pee together i know i say laughing back i know
i i dont remember his name but i remember the first time i met autism
i was in college doing a very short practicum
it was in fact my first practicum
i was placed with a special education teacher at a local elementary school
her classroom served kids of varying disabilities but mostly kids with ld or mild mr
she practiced inclusion and this was my first experience with this hot topic in special education
i observed her sitting at the back of a classroom with a small group of kids while the regular education classroom teacher led a lesson with the rest of the class
so this is inclusion i thought
this isnt what i had in mind but i could do this
but i would do more than observe over my 3 short visits to that school
i asked the special education teacher if i could help her
i wanted to get in there with the kids
they were after all why i was there
she asked me to sit with a little boy and read with him to keep him occupied for a short while
his social skills were strange to me
he came to me when i asked but never looked at my face
his eyes darted quickly from on thing to another mostly at floor or knee level
he sat down with me on a couch in a corner of the classroom
he was the first to open the book and he just took off reading before i could tell him what we were going to be doing
i had no time to ask him about the title the author or the pictures
i was amazed that he could read the book verbatim to me
he was in 1st or 2nd grade and i knew his true reading skills surpassed his supposed ability
i asked him questions as we read the story
i wanted him to explain or expand on the pictures in the book
his answers were yes or no if anything
it seemed he had no idea what we had shared together
i remarked to his teacher later that i was very impressed with his reading but wondered about why he couldnt or didnt answer my questions
the teacher was busy and couldnt quench my inquisitions
i was so uninformed and inexperienced with autism
that teacher couldnt have told me the answer to my questions
like autism itself the answers were complex
ii mathew was four years old and on the flyer he had an angelic face with blond ringlets framing big blue eyes
i answered the ad for a homebased teacher and began doing aba therapy with mathew in his home for 6 hrs
it took me only a few days to fall in love with him
this is good work i thought
this is what i was meant to do
i had another job that year in college working in the merchandise department for a famous band
while i took phone orders and packed tshirts all i could think about was mathew and how the work with him was far more important than satisfying the sticker and cd wishes of teenagers
i was anxious to stop working for the band and when summer ended i split my time between classes and mathew
i learned aba well enough to do it in my sleep
what number what letter good job no try again
ran through my head my dreams were flooded with discrete trials
i worried about mathew and whether i was really being effective
i explained to friends and family that my work with mathew was tedious
i tried to put what we were doing into everyday language
i said were trying to introduce him to our world one thing at a time
i dont think my friends really grasped the idea their puzzled faces said more than their encouraging words
they feigned enthusiasm for my sake
this was becoming my passion
after a full year with mathew i was tired of aba
our sessions had become the same the same drills and the same goals
i cant imagine what mathew was feeling
he was making progress but not enough that i could make sense of it
i had seen one major improvement in him
i told my parents one night during dinner on their drive through my college town that mathew had made gains and i was so excited
i was seeing that he was understanding what we were teaching him
the example i gave was this everyday when i see him i say hi mathew and he answers hi anna usually with a flat affect and no eye contact
i then say what are you doing and there is silence
i prompt him with im sitting im playing nintendo im reading a book im watching tv im eating he repeats my answer and i say good job and we get to work
weve done this a thousand times
its just the way i greet him nothing specific we are working on
then one day around the 7th month into my work with him i walk into his room and say my stock greeting hi mathew
what are you doing im bed he says quietly
i stopped in midstride then i flew to him picked him up threw him in the air saying thats right youre on the bed good job i love it i tickle him and we repeat the sequence me shaping his words with a prompt
this was a good day
i would later learn in my education classes that mathew had generalized the information we were teaching him
he was getting it but i was happy for the reprieve and change of pace that student teaching brought when i had to stop working with mathew
i continued to babysit and stay close with the family but this was my last experience with hardcore aba
it was the foundation for my obsession with autism
it was a good learning experience
iii the first day of my student teaching i knew things would be very different for me
this was a teacch classroom
what i walked into was a mess a scattered and colorful maze of bookshelves and desks
the teacher and tas were just putting everything together after a summer off
there was a relaxed feel and yet there was so much to do
the teacher was a graying hippie who wore overalls and birkenstocks drove a red pickup truck and talked about her horse nelly
shed developed the classroom and program with a fellow teacher
she knew autism backwards and forwards
i knew id learn from her
the first day the kids arrived 8 of them in all i stood and watched and followed mostly with my eyes and mouth wide open
these kids talked in full sentences without prompting the cared for their own belongings they followed their own schedules they played with typical peers they asked for help they were toilet trained
this is not autism is all i could think
i talked with the teacher that first school day when all the kids had left
i had a million questions about each child
why is ethan so lethargic if sadie didnt talk when you first met her how did she learn to talk will kathleen ever read i knew i had to get used to fact that mathew was not autism and autism was not mathew
that classroom proved the spectrum for me in terms of kids in terms of methodologies
autism is a rainbow of colors i got it
iv anthonys parents came to school before school even began
we had to amend his iep
he was switching schools to my newly formed autism classroom and he would be held back in kindergarten for one more try
his mother and father were originally from india
they spoke english but i still found myself speaking loudly and repeating things in simple phrases
i needed to feel that they understood me because i couldnt understand them
anthonys first day in my classroom for kids with autism was my first day too
we both had no idea what we were in for
anthony would spend half a day in kindergarten sharing a ta with another student and half a day with me working academics and adaptive skills
anthony worked hard and was rewarded with playtime
he spent a lot of him playtime having figures interact or simply talking gibberish to himself
he knew english but would only speak when prompted
his parent assured us that they only spoke english at home
this was important for him to learn one language given his challenges
his parents were adamant and i believed them they didnt understand him very much either
he made no eye contact unless i cupped my hands around his big beautiful brown eyes and put him face to mine
anthony was a puzzle and he worried me
then we began to acknowledge his sounds and anytime he used an english word appropriately we threw a small party
soon anthony was throwing his own parties
he would show us his artwork enthusiastically exclaiming look
good job anthony when he would answer a question he would automatically congratulate himself yes good job we would agree with him and then laugh with him
we knew he was repeating us but we couldnt have paid for that pride or that growth
we took it and embraced it anthony was awakening
slowly and surely anthony made strides
he quickly learned to read alongside his peers
he was counting and making patterns
his comprehension was always a bit of a challenge but by 3rd grade he was working on grade level and fully included in his regular education classroom
he was bright and his parents worked with him constantly
he is only one of many success stories but his is one i think of often in terms of extremes
his speech pathologist would often say to me when i was discouraged anna when we tried to evaluate him his first year in kindergarten he was a mess
he would sit in his classroom in the corner rocking and saying gibberish
turns out there was no gibberish there just words that needed shaping and a little boy who needed lots and lots of encouragement and laughter
we happily gave it to him
v autism is a neurological disorder that stems from deficits in social and communication skills and coincides with repetitive behaviors
i often speak of autisms umbrella how add and ocd and mr can all be part of a childs diagnosis but i always feel i fall short when explaining the true nature of the disorder
this is hard for me because i cant possibly relay all the stories and images that had led to my understanding and yet without those stories and images my understanding is weak
i want people to automatically see what i mean when i try to describe how this disorder can present itself and i am so careful that i dont leave a rainman image a one man show of a multifaced disability
i think i always fail rainman is more visual than my words can ever be
and this too is what frustrates me when trying to explain my philosophy in educating people with autism
contrary to my beginning with this disorder i believe in a highly eclectic approach filled with speech therapy occupational therapy sensory integration floortime inclusion schedules behavior plans varied opportunities generalization varied teaching materials and methods all under a child centered extremely structured environment
and above all i believe in spontaneity with these students
how can you be spontaneous in a highly structured environment easy make sure the structure allows for freedom and the kids will blossom
i see the skyline of new york and my stomach does flips
when i unexpectedly come across a picture of new yorks skyline i take in the scene and then have to look away
i cant look too long because the stomach flip will turn into an aching
so i move on and begin to plan a trip back to gotham
ive only visited on short trips
sometimes my visits were so brief they were merely a tease
a onenighter for a private concert a onenight lay over to the dominican and a lunch on spring street in january with snow falling while passing through town
no matter the time ive spent in nyc the city is always with me
this past december i told my friend shortly after we emerged from penn station that i just felt at home in the city
there is so much life in new york and this is what i love must about it
of course there is life everywhere but in nyc it is at its most vibrant
i love that there are people crashing into you on the sidewalks
i love that you can hear the streets and sirens at 4am on the 25thfloor of an apartment building
i love the subways and buses carrying strangers to a million different places
i love that there is a giant patch of green in the middle of the chaos to offer a reprieve and that inside that escape the skyline still impresses its buildings gesturing to come back into the fray
i consume as much media related to new york as i can
i watch every documentary i find rent movies with that take place in new york read books with nyc as the setting and read blogs of nyc dwellers
obsession would be a good word for it but my fascination is more of a hobby
i think about moving there and then life goes on and i forget about it or convince myself that its not really what i want that i need to cultivate the roots here and stay near my family whom i love
but when i see a picture of new yorks skyline my stomach tells me to go back to the obsessing to get online and find a job and an apartment in the city to forget the ties in virginia and to make that leap
why not well i have no answer
all i can say is give me a year well see
the fever is breaking which is a good thing but i would rather be cold than sweating
thanks to my friend j
in texas who urged me to go out and get sick food
i was so hot but my belly is full and that is a good thing however eating salad while breathing through your mouth is a hard thing to do and not choke
im done with the sick updates go back to your lives people ill be blowing my nose and turning up my ac
been under a down comforter for an hour and a half and still freezing
body hurts fever at 100
gingerale and orange sherbert float
i hate having a cold especially when the weather is warm
my head is clogged and nose is stuffed
i just want my bed
right after some meetings at school with parents who probably wont show up and ill just be sitting around twittling my thumbs and wishing for my bed
2 of my 3 meetings scheduled for this morning already didnt happen
2 more nonmeetings to go then home and bed and tv and orange juice
check out the new link on the right 100 things
at one point during every season save for summer i think that this season is my favorite time of the year
i love the point in fall when the leaves have turned their autumnal colors and there is a crispness to the air that only happens in late september and early october
fall smells like new backpacks and fresh notebooks
for me fall signals beginnings though most of nature is ending or falling into a slumber
winter brings the snow that quiets and cleanses everything under its blanket and this usually brings rest from the harried school days
i love the cold and chilled air of winter sleeping under a thickly feathered duvet and throwing on handmade scarves to snuggle my neck
my favorite thing about spring are the honeysuckle flowers
spring sneaks up on me every year
i grow use to the barren trees of winter and somehow dont notice the buds and tinges of green that spring pushes through
then one day all of a sudden there are no more branches on the trees hillsides cascade with green houses are hidden behind rows or clumps of leaves and flowers and shade gracefully covers the precious areas under the trees new dress
its an amazing testament of regrowth
it grows wild along highways alleys schoolyards and backyards any place with a fence to lend climbing space
the bushes are everywhere and when a small honeysuckle breeze blows and catches me off guard i am seven again standing in my front yard on the left side of the house near the alley with my brother and neighborhood friends
the bushes are full grown and you cant be outside without the sweetness luring you
we would gather round the bushes picking the yellow and white flowers as quickly as we could
we wanted as much sweetness as we could get but we were hindered by our work
stealing honeysuckle juice is a delicate task
you must be careful to pluck the whole flower from the bush
then gently holding the flower midway up the petals between two fingers on one hand you pinch the bottom green mass between two fingers on the other hand and pull
the pulling must be slow
you must feel the tiny yellow ball at the end of the delicate stem slipping through the petals grabbing and pushing the honey out of the small hole youve made in the flower
then quickly move the flower and stem to your tongue a moment before you pull the stem from the flower and feel the tiny tickle of sweet watery honey
your tongue has confirmed it
i was strolling through bn one day and noticed that in the sat prep section there were new materials which were not part of my sat study path
i had a tinge of jealousy seeing sat word novels on the shelf
the titles like busted and head over heels accompanied cheesy cover art and promised stories of love and mystery among high school students
these novels are written around common vocab
words found on the sat and those words even appear in bold type within the text
i was jealous because even though i have a ba in english lang
and love to read i hated and struggled with reading throughout elementary middle and high school
my majoring in english was a surprise even to myself because i entered college loathing reading and writing
i even went to the writing center on campus to get assistance with my early college papers and i would come out knowing i had much work ahead of me
i was originally going to major in psychology thinking that i needed this background for teaching
but my heart was never in psychology and when one of the best professors i ever had gave me a c it pushed me to make a change
he was one of the best professors not because of his teaching but because of our talks during my office visits
i went to him often for help because i was failing his class
he became my friend and gave me guidance
i learned about his family and his struggles in college and he helped me see that my world was not in fact collapsing around me
we didnt talk much about the class i was taking from him these were more like therapy sessions
the strange thing about his role in my life that semester and even later when i would go and visit with him is that his specialty was in learning and cognition and he worked primarily with mice
he wasnt trained for the sessions we had and when he handed me chemwipes as i cried during my first visit i knew he would be my friend
after a few sessions in his office the semester was ending and it was time for the final exam
i rocked the socks off of my final but he still gave me a c for the course i was one point away from a b and passing the class
i was heartbroken and felt betrayed
when i went to see him after winter break to discuss my grade he didnt flinch although he had previously and quietly said he would help me if i made a good enough grade on the final
i left his office quietly and quickly that day there was no therapy session to work me through this one and i wasnt that upset surprisingly
he knew what he was doing he knew my heart was not in psychology
with the threat of having to retake that psychology class to finish the major looming in the distance i went on with my other classes
while studying the epic of gilamesh for an anthropology class with a friend i realized i had to change my major
i loved the analysis of psychology but i hated the science of it
english this is where i could find the analysis i craved without any science to confuse my brain
i crammed every english class available into my schedule
i stuck to mostly poetry classes as i thought this was my passion
i think part of me really liked how short poems where
i was still a little afraid of all that reading
but i couldnt avoid it forever and im so glad that i had to read books like a raisin in the sun as i lay dying drown native son cymbeline the color purple and the bluest eye
i wasnt the best at reading all the assigned readings
sir gawain and chaucer didnt excite me and there were colonial american passages that put me to sleep literally
i still struggle with my love hate relationship with reading
i wish i were voracious at it
i think its partly that it takes time for stories to unfold
i wish i could finish books in one sitting like a movie but i read slowly
i read every word and say each one silently in my head
i know there are speedreading methods but i dont want to skip over words i just wish i could read every word faster
a few years ago i started a book journal where i write character maps and synopses of the books i read
its an idea from my 10th grade english teacher and i find it good for me
i have physical proof that ive read a book and it jogs my memory if i cant remember a plot line or character details
in the beginning of the journal i noted words i needed to look up big words not in my daily vocab
this lasted for about 3 books ok just 1 really and then the words i didnt know disappeared from the entries as if ive mastered the english lang
hardly i just got lazy realizing i probably would never use or see those big words again and just began to skim over them
but sometimes i crave bigger words in my head and i wonder if i read sat vocab
novels would i cognize the context clues ascertain the definitions and ameliorate my conversations i doubt it
tonight going to my good friends house to watch the finale of friends um finally thank god i was driving to the middle of nowhere
i hate the suburbs and she and her fiance live so far out that it takes 30 minutes and 2
50 in tolls roundtrip from my apartment in town
so driving i saw this mini cooper with the license plate suvs suc
now i know we guzzle gas and are ruining the ozone but i really wanted to pull his little mini ass over and challenge him to play chicken with my suv
hed be like a crumple soda can after slamming into my sport luxury utility hauling shoes and pretty purses vehicle
so you mini man watch who youre picking on
and my best friend is getting married and sometimes this makes me cry
like tonight it finally hit me and i cried
ps i love mini coopers being obsessed with all things british
but dont mess with my suv
of course ive thought about it happening
ive envisioned how it would happen and what i might do
ive considered that i should devise a plan if it happened just to be prepared
well it happened and i had no plan no diagram to show me what to do
this morning i woke up with a headache thinking as i do every morning that i just want to get back in bed i want to call in sick
but i never do call in sick
i turn on the coffee maker get dressed fix lunch and when the coffee is ready i begin sipping it while quietly saying a prayer that my empty stomach will except the legal stimulate and take it straight to my brain
this morning the coffee couldnt work fast enough and the headache required 2 ibuprofen
praying to the overthecounter drug gods that the medicine too would go straight to my brain i began looking for my keys
i couldnt find them and my head hurt too much to search really hard
so i grabbed the spare set with its spare car key spare car remote clicker thing and spare apartment key
the clicker thing was the slightly used one i had traded for the unused one a few months ago thinking that the battery in it had run its course
its a sad little keychain with only the three danglers but it would have to do i was running late
it was a wet morning and this time i remembered my spare umbrella in case the heavens opened up on me as i went from school to school
i stepped out of my apartment coffee in hand and as i approached my car the spare clicker wasnt working
i figured its tiny battery was in fact dead and opened the drivers side door with my key
i then tried to manually unlock the rear doors by using the power unlock button on the driver side door i know not really manually
i hopped in put my bags on the passenger seat set my coffee in its holder and put the key in the ignition
upon turning it i got nothing
i mean nothing not even the usual piddily sound the altenater makes when its trying to charge the battery when in fact the battery is dead
all signs were pointing to a dead battery but no noise that was strange
i was confused and then remembered how the ignition had been acting funny the last few days
here is where i needed the plan and had none
i first said a quick thank you to god that i was a support teacher and did not have a classroom full of kids waiting on me and then a bit of panic set in
what do you when you are almost late for work as it is and everyone you know is probably at work already
i called my brother he had to take the kids to school and even if he could get me to work i couldnt travel to my other schools and id have to take care of the car today anyway
so i had to call in
i was getting my early morning wish but really this was not the way i had wanted it
having no plan i couldnt figure out how to call in do i call in sick or is this personal business do i call in for a half day and hope my brain clears and i figure out how to get to school for the last half of the day who can help me how long with aaa take i ended up calling in for the whole day
car troubles have notoriously taken whole days before so i thought i would play it safe and not confuse the day even more by having to try to get to school by a certain time
the dealership was able to expensively fix everything by the end of the day and i can go to school easily and safely again
im just wondering do you have a plan if it happens to you
this past weekend i went to winstonsalem nc to a cousins wedding on my dads side
i am not close to this side of my family my dad having only brothers and brothers are less likely to gather their respective families together often enough for children to form bonds
i do see my cousin a
every thanksgiving at our house though i dont really know her
she is however sweet and kind and so i was happy to go to her wedding
i was however happier to also spend time with my cousin loves a
my mother has two sisters and while both live in different cities in north carolina all of our families have grown up together
we have spent almost every holiday together camping vacations at the beach and weeks at lake norman nc
my cousins and i a total of 3 girls and 1 boy havent always been great friends but we were great playmates growing up
we were around each other so much that it seemed like we were brothers and sisters
we played we fought we played again and then we went to college
when we grew older we became friends
trips to visit each other and weekly phone calls developed
we became good friends we were happy our mothers brought us together we were happy for our cousin love
cousin love is how we address each other and we do it with a southern drawl
it ends up sounding like cuzzin luuuuv
it is merely a way to say im glad youre in my life
im glad youre my cousin and i love you
cousin loves have begun to multiply
there are now wives and soontobe husbands and im sure there will be children soon too
we welcome the additions and affectionately extend the cousin love name
our children will continue to be cousins though growing more and more distant in a familial since
we know they will grow up together we hope too that they will develop innocent cousin love and see the joy of friendship that we have
we have a tentative plan to save our monies and buy a beach house
we want to name it cousin love but know that the world would think us odd
so in spanish it would be primo amor
and in italian it also means first love and this sounds good to us
so this past friday night after the rehearsal dinner for a
s wedding i took my newly found cousin from my fathers side over to a
s house for some quality time
it was fun good drinks good conversation
it was like we had all been friends forever
it was what cousin love is all about
from my dads side blended right in
in fact weve convinced her to come to thanksgiving this year to continue and expand the cousin love
the cousin love was so good i felt full up full up of the kind of love that lets your know you have all you need in the world
the next night at a
s wedding i sat with my mom and dad my dads cousins one of my dads brothers and my cousin r
they did their prescribed wedding things the first dance as husband and wife the fatherdaughter dance the cake cutting and the throwing of the garter
as i watched them cut the cake i felt full up again
i felt no envy of a
there was no sense that i was missing something
i realized then that i love my family i love my life and i am happy
how do we meet them when do we know they will be important in our lives what are the signs that certain people are meant to change you permanently this weekend i found a good friend and luckily she is part of my family
at our mutual cousins wedding we met again after probably 15 years
i dont even remember the last time i saw her but it was probably at our north carolina family reunion eating chicken stew cooked in a large cast iron kettle over an open flame
surrounded by family i didnt know very well and in the mist of teenage angst i guess i didnt realize what an amazing person r
funnily too we lived an hour away from each other at one point in college and never made the trip over the mountains to meet
currently lives in nyc pursuing her passion poetry
shes been through college graduate school and now another masters degree for writing
shes lived almost a whole life since we last talked and i guess i have too
we talked about nyc and my passion for that city and about poetry
we have more in common than i can believe
she is someone i wish had always been in my life and she was i just didnt know it
the cousins wedding whom we were celebrating was brought about through similar circumstances
had gone to high school together but didnt run in the same circles
they both went on to college and jobs and lived in various other cities then met again a few years ago while both were back in their hometown
their friends say that a
are perfect together they compliment each other and that they are deeply in love
why does it take years sometimes lifetimes to realize that people who surround you are the ones that will compliment you in ways you cant even fathom it is as if we are not ready at times
friends lovers husbands and wives may pass us along the street but until we have fully grown into ourselves it doesnt matter how often we meet
when we are ready hopefully they will be there
its as if we are all just ships passing in the night and im so thankful when somehow we meet again and our lives begin a new direction
they are taking care of me which is nice since the tetanus shot has ruined my left arm i got a splinter in my good foot hopping around and all of my muscles are sore from having to be used all of a sudden in ways they are not used to
anyway enough of the moaning and groaning i should be halfwalking in a few days
my family is taking me to the beach to be waited on
i cant go in the sun with the antibiotics that im on and i cant get my foot wet
its all good i dont like the sand and saltwater anyway
so im off for a week
im being driven 4 hours to sit in a house and have people bring me things
ill be knitting up a storm and reading and watching my little nieces and nephew play
i wish i could play with them
so no blogging for a week
come back im sure ill have lots to say when i return to you as long as you return to me
and it seems i should have stayed there
the infection is way better today but i was really groggy from the vicodin this morning
i had to take it last night to sleep through the pain
then this morning i went to fix some eggs and toast and just when i was going to put the food on the plate i stepped on a blade that had fallen from a cabinet that i forgot about and didnt see
i sliced my foot wide open and now have 6 stitches
ive never had stitches and i was not the best patient for the poor doctor
this has been a rough two days
im going to bed and please dont call cause i cant walk to get the phone
so i have an infection and from 6 to 1045pm was in some serious pain
i went to a prompt care place nearby and pretty much cried the whole time as the pain got worse and worse
i thought about not going about toughing it out
i dont like to look like a hypochondriac but after phone calls to mom and the worsening of the pain i couldnt not go
ive never seen any of the staff before and i went by myself so im sure the staff saw this crying girl and was like ok whats going on there as they sent me from the bathroom to xray room to testing room and 2 people walked in on me undressing then dressing i cried
i cried around the nurse the doctor the xray tech
i winced and moaned and squirmed like i was having a baby
im not a crier and as a woman i can handle pain in the abdominal area pretty well
i couldnt stop the tears the pain was too much
so after all the testing and crying the doctor on call gave me a bottle of vicodin
i think he felt sorry for me
ive taken the other meds but not the vicodin yet
that powerful a drug scares me
and thanks to the beautiful power of antibiotics we are talkin serious ones here and gentle tylenol i can walk and sit without moaning
and im sure if i take the vicodin ill love you too
yesterday the phone rang while i was brushing my teeth
mouth full or foam and sonic still buzzing i run around looking for my cell phone
when i locate it deep in the depths of my purse i dont recognize the number and think that i need to answer it quickly
and then like a dumbass i do
my muffled hello allows the person on the other end to identify himself
while he does so im thinking what do i do now i cant talk like this
do i swallow it ew or spit while hes on the phone
hell i decide on spitting and just confess it hes already heard me sound as if im under water
so i say hold on im brushing my teeth then go to the sink to spit sonic turned off but still in my hand
i apologize to him when i return and hope that he didnt hear me spitting in the sink 3 feet away from the phone
i realize what a dumbass like answering the phone at that moment was so important that it superseded the mouth full of water and paste
what what was i thinking sometimes i wonder
ive realized it is real work being a girl
the maintenance is insane and usually i am not great at making regular appointments for the filing and plucking and cutting and tweezing and polishing
i usually get things done on a whim or because i cant take the jungle growing above my eyes anymore
home upkeep is far cheaper but i am far from skilled enough to keep it up
i try for a few weeks and then i have to revert to the professionals
ive never really been the kind to have one hairdresser that i go to excusively
a college roommate would travel 45 minutes back home to get her hair done and still goes to the same lady today though now the commute is about an hour or more
sure a good hairstylist is hard to find but there are several out there in every city
ive never had a fear of the haircuts either
ive walked into salons for the first time and told the stylist to just do whatever they wanted to do
some stylists like this others not so much
i havent really ever had a bad experience
one hairdresser said that i didnt have to worry about my hair framing my face while other women used their hair to enhance their features and thus the anxiety they have
i think she was complimenting me
she also gave me one of the best haircuts and i ended up going back to her a few times
in the 10 months that ive lived in richmond ive had my hair cut three times by three different people none were bad but none were exceptional either
today my stylist was daniel a thin man with spiked dirty blond hair who smelled like cigarettes and herbal shampoo
i was apprehensive at first for a man to be plucking my eyebrows and cutting my hair and then he spoke and walked
there is something comforting about a gay man being in charge of your beauty needs
i told him i just needed a trim and he guided me to a sink then said wed do the eyebrows first so we went to back room with a comfy bedlike chair
he worked on my eyebrows longer than most women stylists have
he plucked the small thin straggling hairs at the top corners of my brows and only put the wax on once
he massaged the areas wear he had waxed and plucked
he took his time and care
i was disappointed that he didnt massage my head when he shampooed my hair
i expected he was an extended massager he wasnt
as we walked to his styling chair i wanted to tell him to do whatever he wanted with my hair to put his spin on it
as he was combing out i my hair i wanted to tell him to be creative do what he thought was best for my face
i sat quietly and watched the other customers
he never asked how much i wanted taken off
he just took my hair and started cutting
he cut it to a healthy length parted it down the middle and added subtle layers
he did this without asking or telling me
he cut and cut and cut the layers taking time and many head tilts
when he was finished cutting he put straightening cream and hair gel into my wet hair and blew it dry using a rolled brush to straighten and turn the ends under a skill i can never get down
he didnt talk much nor did i but when he did he said things like rock and roll and twisted
with these words i realized we couldnt be friends
hours after meeting him he lingers
when my hair swishes or i brush it out of my face i smell him cigarettes and herbs
in the time that i walked in looking for a simple trim and walked out with a hairstyle daniel became my hairdresser
im committing to him like no other man
i know at least he will take his time and care and hell give me what i need without even asking
for weeks i have been wondering when exactly fathers day is
i know of course that its in june and on a sunday
but i feel like it moves around from year to year
i have however just learned that its always the 3rd sunday of june each year
hmm i really have trouble with dates
actually horrible is probably not strong enough a word
my best friend and i will often send birthday cards that are 6 months late
but we know thats the way it is and we accept it wholeheartedly
others however are not so kind
ive known people to really get offended by others forgetting their birthdays
thats just damn selfish in my opinion
im not a big birthday celebrator and never really have been
im trying to get better at it but dates elude me
like today i was reading my daily blogs when jennifer weiners post mentions fathers day and i have one of those oh my god ive got to call my dad moments
i ran around looking for my cell phone and as im talking to my dad i realize that i have not sent a card or anything
i quickly realize i will try to remedy the situation next week at family beach week but still shitty shitty of me
i sent my mom a moms day card a day late of course but nothing for my old dad who loves me so unconditionally
its not personal i just suck
well i guess in my case weve established why there is no daughters day
on the bright side maybe the fathers day cards will be halfprice tomorrow
its my new favorite wrapping material
ive just wrapped 2 presents for todays scheduled parties and yes one is wedding related and yes im over it
as i went through my quite vast assortment of wrapping material i landed on the cellophane for the first package because i had to due to its odd shape and then i just had to us the cellophane again for the next one its just too fun
and while wrapping i walked around singing cellophane mister cellophane from chicago
and now im just chillin before i have to leave to drive all over virginia in one day
im usually a last minute shopper and would typically be out buying the presents right now
but ive learned to stockpile presents so that i can just pull from the bunch and go
but my last minuteness is not totally gone im really waiting on my clothes in the dryer and i was suppose to leave like 5 minutes ago
oh well people love me anyway despite all the lateness and last minute presents tags still on
i am in fact not miss cellophane cause you gotta notice the girl who is fashionably late
last night at about 930 i had the bright idea of going to see raising helen
some friends had already seen it and since i had no work the next day i could handle to the late night showing at 955
so i hopped in the car and raced to the west end to the stadium seats
it was me and three couples
wonderful nothing like smug couples on a thursday night date
i took my own row settled in and put my feet up
i started going to movies alone about 5 years ago when in college an impossibly popular coworker divulged her love of going to movies on her own
i was appalled and shocked
why in the hell would a 20 yearold blond size 2 charming and smart girl ever go to the movies by herself she explained that her mother did it and that she liked it
she would often be shopping and find a movie on and just go
i thought she was brave
it took me a good year before i braved the movies alone
it must have been uneventful as i dont even remember the movie that ended my solo movie going virginity
now i dont even think twice about it and yet i think im still a bit of a rebel in the venture
i dont think my friends do this
i even have a friend who doesnt like to rent movies alone
movie watching is a solitary act anyway unless of course you are at home snuggled up on a couch
so if a movie is out that i want to see and no one else does or im near a movie theatre and see something interesting or im bored at home and need to do something other than stare at myself ill go to a movie alone
no big deal it just happens
so last night was raising helen
sad bit of a movie if you ask me
the plot was weak and lame and not well thought out
there were scenes were i literally wanted to rewind and rewrite and then there were the ever present continuity issues where the clothes in one scene are the same in the next scene although its a different day
this movie overall has bad writing bad editing and not really great acting although i still adore kate hudson john corbett and joan cusak
what were they thinking anyway good premise just not well done
and im beginning to rethink things about my friends who said it was so cute
and then because i could i went walmarting at midnight
i stepped into the walmart at 1215am and spent the next 45 minutes shopping the supper center
it was fabulous and surreal
tons of people were about mostly walmart workers restocking the shelves and a few customers
there were boxes everywhere which you had to navigate around
the restockers would sometimes give me weird glances like it was crazy that i was bargain shopping in the middle of the night on a thursday
please like its not weird that you are working at walmart in the middle of the night
yarn was had because well the kitting has not stopped
and then because i could i got some fresh produce and checked out at 1am
wonder if that is what sam walton envisioned for his supper store
so i went to the doctor yesterday to get a mole checked out
since i had blistering sunburn 10 years ago i have been cautious with suspicious items on my skin
turns out that melanoma does not necessarily strike the area that was burned interesting
and the mole or whatever seems to be nothing thank god
this was my first visit to this doctor in richmond so i had to fill out all the info
sheets and sign away my life literally
well since it was the last day of school i had a little trouble leaving when i wanted to and then when i got to the hospital there was an unexpected game of chicken for the limited parking spaces
so i finally grab one and walk quickly through the soupy muggy air wearing jeans no less and make it to the fourth floor about 7 minutes late for the appointment
i get my papers and sit down
i write and write and then pause to actually read the clauses before i sign them when the receptionist moves the glass plate that blocks out the waiting area um its glass people we can still see and hear you and this is what she says miss banana the nurse is waiting for you because she was expecting you at 330
can you write faster because youre late yeah ok i say
and then it dawns on me that i should have stood up on a chair or something and announced to the waiting area hi my name is anna and ill be late today
i woke up early this morning to a fog a thick fog over the city
it nestled in the trees in the courtyard of my apartment building
it was tranquil and quieted the morning like a blanket of snow
i havent seen a fog in years probably becuase i sleep through them
but today the fog mimiced the fog ive been under for the last few days
not a bad fog just a mindless in a daze fog where i leave important confidential documents on a copier dont put an important piece of info
into folders cant comprehend questions asked of me cant understand what i am reading
ive been in a haze but now its midday and the fog is gone the sun has burned it away
its the last day for teachers my files are completed ive helped other teachers clean up their rooms and mail letters home
one year down a million more to go
but for now for the summer im free
plans for the beach la and nyc are being made and of course all the weddings
happiness abounds with the sunshine raining down
pool days and sleeping in and reading books and unexpected trips and movies and relaxation and freedom
its good to be a teacher when its summer in the city
sex and the city on tbs
fall in love people all over again
and by that i mean knitters anonymous because i am addicted
i decided to pick up knitting again this weekend and have so far knitted 2 scarves and begun three more
i even raced after school to a knitting store that closes at four so that i could buy way too much yarn for half price
but at least my friends will nice have nice yarn in their scarves instead of the walmart brands
i want to constantly be knitting
ive even started knitting in bed with no lights on
thats right knitting in the dark sexy
and yesterday i had to refrain from taking the knitting to the bathroom with me
knitting is on the brain so much that its all i think about at least for the last few days
like when im at work or out with friends i keep thining i really wish i had my knitting right now
i really want to finish that scarf
its like i need a bumper sticker that says id rather be knitting
and no there is no purling just kniting and knitting and knitting
see the obsession its bad and well i need to get back to the needles and the yarn
tonight was yet another wedding related event a surprise semishower for the friend and coteacher
enough with the wedding stuff already
the showers and the bachelorette parties and the girls weekends and the weddings
i mean there is no money left the well is dry
im really going to be weddinged out by november
dear lord make me a bird so i can fly far far away
dear lord make me a bird so i can fly far far away
or maybe ill just bring my knitting and then it will all be bareable
woke up around 1130 which really not that late but considering it was drunk sleep it was far to early
my head hurt and i felt like a ton of bricks hit me so back to bed i went at 2 pm for a long nap
i dont even know how i got that drunk or if i was that drunk
i didnt drink that much although people were handing us shots all night but those fruity shots dont have much alcohol in them
and i had my wits about me at the end of the night
i was probbably the most sobber one there
so what the hell with the hangover anyway its currently 5pm and i need to get on with my day or whats left of it
its summer well almost and not officially but heat wise it is summer in the city
poor virginia it is plagued with humidity and hot summers
i know our summers are not like texas summers or louisiana summers but they are hot enough for me
i dont believe in snootiness but sometimes i wish i were a person who summers somewhere else if just to get away from the nastiness
maine maine sounds good or maybe even canada
the only thing really good about the heat is that pools open and there are trips to natural bodies of water
every year my family takes a beach trip
i actually hate sand and saltwater but i love the laziness of a beach week
i take about ten books and i just read and play with children and read some more
and then there is of course the eating of the shrimp and crab
there is always the eating of the shrimp and crab
but before and after the beach there is the pool
growing up we belonged to our local elks club an organization i really dont understand except that there were usually old men there at any given time throughout the day and they could be found at the bar inside the clubhouse
ive never found out what the organization stood for or against and as soon as the last child me went to college my fathers membership ran out
we used the place for the pool and the pool only
the local pool a place where you learn to swim from the coolest man you have ever seen because he wears sunglasses underwater where you strengthen friendships over adult swim breaks and during shark in the deep end and where you tackle the fear of the high dive
i never joined the swim team but i was a lifeguard for 2 summers
lifeguarding is the best job ever invented
sometimes i think about going back to lifeguarding with my summers off but then i think that the current 16 year olds would find me a bit strange and i would certainly not fit into their lifeguarding clique
i got my lifeguarding kicks back in the day anyway
i just really miss the twirling the twirling of the whistle while sitting in the tall chair with a high vantage point the sun so strong you can see your legs tanning before you eyes
the pool is now what i go to with my nieces and nephew
none know how to swim yet but i am determined to solve that one
my favorite thing to do with them is to take each one individually in my arms and pull them across the pool from the shallow to the deep end
on the crosspool treks our faces close together we pretend different things sometimes they practice kicking or just floating
when water rushes into their mouth and nose i know its a 5050 chance of them quitting the trek midpool
but the other day my precious niece coughed it out and swallowed hard then said in three yearold voice annie i want to ride the waves again
you see we were pretending to be on the ocean and waves were gently bouncing us up and down hence the water in the nose from the crashing wave
i love that it turns a three yearold into a chlorine swallowing wave rider
there is this guy i know but he shall remain nameless although i might be related to him
he is one of the funniest people i know and whenever i am around him i know that we will be laughing so hard that we fall over
however last night i discovered he is the biggest dork i know
we are both obsessed with apple
like last week i emailed him about the new apple airport express and he emails me back and is like i was reading about it just when you emailed
and then the next day he calls me and we chat for like half an hour about how the world really needs to know that apple is so superior and really people would be happier if they just owned an apple and businesses were run on apples
we discover it is a futile attempt but our love for apple will never die
this guy is a certified windows programmer and even interviewed for a job at microsoft so his love for apple is even more special than mine
he converted about 4 years ago and has not looked back since
in fact hes a little pissed at people who like pcs
he loves apple so much that he gets magazines about apple and somehow is in the loop of rumors about the new products they are creating
i know there are rumor websites and he probably surfs them
its all a business related obsession since he programs all day
i have to confess that if i understood all that computer jargon i would be in on it too
i just dont have time to learn all that stuff about computers i just know i love apple
i also know that he is my apple lovin hero and he is there to dispense knowledge should i have a technical quetions
he rocks my apple lovin world
well so last night he was telling me about the last issue of mac world
alton brown gave an interview and developed a special recipe to celebrate apple
the name of the dish is apple macaroni and cheese
then this guy that i adorewent on to tell me that at the last mac expo or whatever when steve jobs gave his closing statement he had a friend over to his house during their lunch hour and they watched it on the internet while eating macaroni and then for dessert they had applesauce
oh dear one i still still adore the hell out of you
ronald regans body will be lying in state on thursday at the capitol in dc
although i dont really have the money to spend on gas when will i ever get to see a president lying in state in the near future and really its not about the pomp and circumstance its about ronnie
hes the only president i feel personally connected to and its not about his politics or his cuddly nature and love for his wife or that even a president can be human and have family problems too
you see ole ronnie and i have the same birthday
big deal you say you also share it with bob marley
but bob didnt send me a birthday letter when he was president
it was 1988 i was eleven and this was the last year for reagan in the white house
i thought my sharing his birthday was the coolest thing
i had no idea what his politics where nor did i care
i considered myself a republican then because my parents were republicans and so this extra kinship with ronnie felt strong
my mom had the brilliant idea of sending him a birthday card and announcing the importance of the shared date
i was a little apprehensive how exactly do you tell a stranger much less a president that you have the same birthday why would he even care well we bought a card and wrote a note
im sure my mom helped craft the sentence or else it would have been something like i was born on feb
and well thats probably what it did say
so off went the card and about 3 weeks later arrived a letter from the white house
it was the most exciting day of my eleven yearold life
my family was thrilled too
i learned of his death on saturday night after a full day spent with old college friends
a friend was looking at the now framed letter on my living room wall and said that reagan had died today
then i thought about peace and that it seemed so expected and so natural
ive dealt with alzheimers in my family and it is trying disease on everyone
i told my friends that it was probably for the best for him and his family
then i went to the letter
he or a staff writer wrote a short and sweet letter
it is typed on a typewriter
the date is offcenter from the letterhead and the eagle emblem
it begins by acknowledging our mutual birthday
then in presidential fashion goes into the history of febuuary birthdays including george washington and abraham lincoln
he tells me to study these great men and hopes they will inspire me the way they have inspired him
the letter ends with mrs
raegan joining him in his wishes and may god bless me
his name is signed simply ronald reagan no mention of president anywhere
we think he really signed it
it doesnt seem to be a stamp
i will probably never truly know
my eleven yearold heart knows he touched this letter somehow
in the bottom left hand corner is my full name and childhood address
my name has a typo
since the beginning of the letter i have gone from anna to anny
at eleven this typo crushed me
it makes the whole letter so much more real so much like the man whos birthday i share
dear president reagan i am honored to have shared your birthday
every february 6 i will continue to remember your birthday and those of the other great presidents you mentioned
washington and lincoln were truly amazing but they dont mean as much to me
i cant look over at my wall and see their handwriting
i loved your letter and will always cherish it
may you and your family find the peace you deserve and thank you from my eleven yearold self and from me now for all you did for our world
shes been all over the country and germany her family moving from place to place every few years
somehow she has roots in the midwest and virginia
im thankful for those virginia roots happy they brought her friendship to my door literally
ohio claimed her during undergrad
i guess she still is
id like to think she is more a wahoo but its not my choice who wins out
the buckeyes could probably kick our wahoos football ass any day
now lives in austin and owns a home there
her settlement came by way of miami and seattle her traveling childhood brought to the surface in young professionalhood
i think she is resilient
she lived 3 doors down from me in one of thomas jeffersons original rooms at his university
we had fireplaces wood floors a sink inside a closet and a bathroom we had to walk outside to use
not exactly an outhouse but close enough
was only there for one semester
we spent hours chatting in our rooms at night walking from room to room in our pajamas outside
when she left it was winter and cold the freezing temps
had been lifted by fires in our fireplaces
our individual rooms heated the old fashion way
was the best at making a fire that didnt smoke the room out
i was sad to see her go and begged her to stay to change her practicum placement to virginia not kentucky
but her plans were made far before any of us moved to the range
so she left but came back for foxfields and a new years party in a cabin in the woods
she is smart logical sensible and yet just as neurotic as i am well maybe not
we talk about how much our lives have mirrored each others while she moved from state to state or country to country and i lived in the same pink bedroom for 18 years
im so glad she stayed for that last semester
im so glad she couldnt find an apartment or dorm room for those few months
im so glad we are friends
and i love her couch or air mattress in her tiny crosscountry apartments
shes an anchor in my life a friend who will always be there and never feel that far away no matter the actual distance
restaurants are closing or are closed by now
its late but youre hungry
youre not sure you want to cook but you really want a salad
drive to ukrops on your way home
rifle through your dashboard cds looking for emmylou harris
you need emmylous mellow voice to match your mellow mood
shes not there but youre happy you find johnathan rice
put it in the cd slot
the volume is louder than you expect but you dont change it realizing quiet hushed voices is what you were really craving
sing along to it with the sunroof open
dont mind the people in the parking lot looking at you with bass flowing out the open windows
park knowing you are only pausing the moment
pick up romaine lettuce and chevre
a salmon fillet is a sudden passing desire you grab it and hummus for snacking
check yourself out in the selfserve lane
get back in the car
turn the key and hit the sunroof button
keep the duet with johnathan going
feel your brothers bass in the floorboards and through the speakers in the door
know that you cant go home
you want to drive and listen and feel the wind
there are no mountains here no country roads just 5 minutes away
head toward home but pass it
make the right hand turn you make every morning on the way to work
take the toll road the downtown expressway
you need a hit from the city buildings the skyline up close and 50 is worth it
pass rosewood and the u of r stadium
slow at the toll booth until the smarttag signals a green light to keep going
speed up a horse out of the gate
pass vcu and the cherry st
exit and thomas jeffersons capitol building
go under a quarter mile of overpasses with lights burning a fluorescent tunnel
emerge to the buildings of downtown richmond
wonder why so many lights are on
follow the signs to 95 north and 64 west washington and charlottesville
curve around on the highway bridge through low buildings
look out the window to the left at the taller lit buildings
i want to love this city
be amazed that you are driving so close to the bricks and concrete
see the clock tower of the renovated main st
train station on the right side you can almost touch it
get off at the broad st
go quickly through shockoe bottom
remember the recent attacks here
get back to 95 going south this time to petersburg
stay in the right hand lane curve right at exit 73c toward the powhite
imagine you are not driving but are suspended floating through these buildings under the highway above you
look through the windows of la difference
wish you understood the difference
go back through the tunnel of lights
pass the jefferson hotel and the governors mansion
i want to love this citys history
pass the exit for the boulevard
quell the wish to live there in an apartment alongside virginias museums and with a balcony
go on to cary st
park and walk to your building
with the full moon behind say quietly and to no one i want to love this city
decide its too late for salmon
get a large bowl out
pour the salad into it
begin to toast pecans from the freezer
crumble the chevre over the lettuce
pour on your homemade balsamic dressing
take a bite as you walk to the living room to your computer
realize you are a good cook that this salad should be on menus
sit down at your laptop
listen to him and write this
them silence me hello them yes is this mrs
so and so me yes them hi mrs
im calling for the richmond fraternal order of police me hello
im sorry did you think i was home im actually not able to answer your call right now
gotcha ha ha please leave a message unless this is a computer operated telemarketer in which case do not ever call me again or i will bite you
if this is the richmond fraternal order of police then also do not call me again unless you have actually done something about the 10 murders that happen each month in our fair city especially those that happen around the schools i teach in
when i feel good and safe about driving to the schools i teach in those schools which sadly produce men that will kill others on the same streets ill answer youre call
and listen were working on educating kids that dont kill
im not so sure about your fraternal orderness
so until that time stop
im thinking im not a mrs
which means you are a telemarketer asshole cause no one else calls me mrs
what i really said was ive asked you five times to stop calling me especially early in the morning and especially on sundays
this was followed by an abrupt click
sometimes i wish i was a quicker with the unsolicited phone call comebacks
its all about the gmail
new email to the right
read it copy it paste it write it send it
in short email it to me the gapgirl is ready for mail
im sitting at the getty along a path to the side of one of the buildings
im in the shade and leaning against the structures massive stonewall
im on a pathway to a terrace though its a path that is almost hidden
people have to navigate around me as they walk through
i wish theyd go away and leave this public space private for me only
i can see a vast view of la from where i sit from the hills to the oceans
ahead and slightly to the right is a small clump of tall buildings that make up downtown
beverly hills is just below me
there is a fire billowing on a mountain a few miles away
its in santa clarita a passerby says
the smoke wont reach la because the winds blow toward the east toward the mountains
it looks both ominous and soft like a cloud
to the left and over the hills from the getty is the valley and pasadena though i cant see them i know they are there with clichd houses and perfect lawns
there is smog that hangs in the air between the landscape and the sky a visible reminder of this cities population
to my right if i careen around i can see the sea and catalina island poking its head just above the haze
the 405 are below me and the traffic crawls from north and south
planes line up in the sky ahead waiting to land at lax
this city is huge a massive gallimaufry of rich and poor everyday and famous
the rich build houses on the mountains or even cliffs ignoring the impending possibility of earthquakes
they look like cracker or thin wafers that could tumble down like rocks sliding
california has its own style to everything but the houses in la interest me the most
their style is a mix of mediterranean spanish and american classic
the rich modern houses are minimalist with hard lines and lots of glass but mostly there is stucco tan and smooth
it is the red brick of southern california
the getty is an amazing place
a free art museum open to the public
but people dont usually come for the art they come to see the getty
it is a vast structure of buildings placed on a hillside overlooking all this city has to offer
it is made of an offwhite stone creating straight lines and curved walls
the landscaping is immense green and perfect
fountains pop up in many places an offering of serenity
the buildings are so large that looking back on them from on of the many terraces and seeing people walking around on the balconies and inside through the glass they look like tiny bugs like insignificant unimportant things
people stand against the railings where i sit
they squint and point trying to comprehend what they see
the wind is strong at times on this hill
they sun beats down an arid hotness but in the shade of the building a chill awaits
what to say about a
only she will know what the title of this post means
she is a dear college friend whom i lived with for 4 years 4 crazy party filled and chilled out years
when i first met her i didnt think i liked her because she is so honest that it can be abrupt at times
then her roommate went home for an extended time due to illness and a
and i became good friends and i saw her kinder gentler side
i ended up staying in her roommates bed quite often because my roommate was a freak of nature and i just needed to get away even if it was across the hall
im so glad we became friends and that she is in my life
is the kind of friend who is there for you no matter what
shell be there to help you move in to your new apartment or celebrate you graduation a year after she celebrated her own
she is honest and doesnt judge
when confronted with people who are quite strange she says it takes all kinds to make the world go round
we use to rag her in college because the words my mommy says preceded almost every piece of factual or advice laden talk
well her mommy did a great job
she is a great girl and a good friend
she married a few years ago
he is a boy who counteracts all that we college friends thought she was
he is country and mild mannered and loves hunting and listens to country music and watches racing
was a bit wild in college so when we found out her choice we were a little confused
it turns out that the domesticated life filled with good cooking and family all around is really her true self
her inlaws love her as much as we do and she has found a niche for herself and her husband
they are beginning to build a house on 20 acres of land in the country soon
i tell her that as soon as she puts a pool in ill be there
land on this auspicious day and bid you a good one
may tiny pictures from walmart decorate the halls
why people again google has sent someone to my site who typed in together to pee
ahh little elizabeth bishop was so right
so ive lost my keys
they are in north carolina
i didnt realize i didnt have them until i awoke from the early morning drive back to my parents house
many phone calls later they are hopefully being fedexed to me and will arrive tuesday sometime
im trapped at my parents house which isnt bad except when you want to be in your home you want to be in your home
and i want to be in my home
say some prayers people may fedex not lose that package
ive never lost my keys before and really its not a huge deal though it may look like write it like disaster
the la chronicles are not over but i have been busy washing clothes making gifts and repacking for another weekend of wedding festivities
so ill be away from bloggerland for another few days
in the meantime go to my little blogchilds site
yes yes anna has a child in bloggerland that is
i never thought i would like los angeles
i thought i was an east coast girl through and through
turns out i could go either way
los angeles isnt anything i thought it would be
it wasnt as flashy as i had imagined
it didnt seemed as pretentious as it looks on tv and there was no preparing me for the weather
la was amazing and good to me
i tend to fall in love with most cities that i visit
maybe its because travel is a carefree existence or maybe its because each city beckons to a different part of me
why did i fall in love with la well it isnt the rat race it seems to be or maybe i never came in contact with part of it
and the sun shines everyday
there are never clouds in the sky or rainy mucky days there are also not stars
i knew this about la but i didnt believe it
my clouded east coast brain couldnt fathom endless days of pure sunshine
how could you be sad in a place like this because whatever happens at least its a beautiful day
my love for la is fleeting though
i know when i am home ill settle back into the humidity and heat and then the cool air of fall and the snow of winter
i would miss the seasons if i lived here
endless days of sitting by the pool would begin to disorient me
life here would be like an endless vacation
it would be like play like pretend just beyond the touch of reality
and my love for la is not true because it is shared with my love for london new york san francisco seattle and morehead city
la is just another city to add to the list of places i could live if i ever decided to pack up and leave the state and family i know so well
i never do make plans to move to the cities i love so much because i think if i lived there the magic would begin to disappear after a time and i dont want that to happen
id rather hold these cities in my heart as perfect gems nestled on hillsides or islands or by the sea covered in fog or basking in sunlight
lots of things to say but im tired and trying to get back to east coast time
i love and miss la
ill tell ya all about it later
time to watch movies and relax
im off to la for fun in the sun with my best friend
its the last of a girls romp before she you guessed it gets married
i plan to do some touristy things and then just hang with my best gal pal
i miss her and ill miss her even more when she gets hitched because girlfriends change ever so slightly when marriage happens
i was hoping wed hop over to vegas for the weekend but weve opted for time in la with her fianc
well i love them both loads and loads
im excited to see them either in a flashy city or just in their living room
have to say though kinda wish i was going to see a booby show
ill blog at ya next week
we at mind the gap are a happy and loving lot
we like diversity and we like to celebrate with our friends when they have things to celebrate
today is such a day today is bastille day in france a day of celebrating the end of monarchal rule
and so in honor of our french friends a list of things we love from france or things that france pimped out to us
the statue of liberty le baguette yummy the colors of the french flag fashion le croissant even yummier dijon mustard champagne cannes film festival toy dogs because the french took them everywhere long before paris hilton was born jaques costeau les mis though in french it would be lost on me jeanmarc gaspard itard and the wild boy of aveyron matisse degas la tour cezanne monet rodin renior to name a few joan of arc let them eat cake
this list does not endorse the loving of all things french because those french bastards didnt go to iraq with us so we said the hell with you too
our amazing and welcoming country forgot that french troops helped us in the american revolution and about the gift that france once bestowed on us the statue of liberty and said well call french fries freedom fries instead ignoring the fact that french fries are actually from belgium
ha take that you french bastards our government said
well those french bastards were pretty spot on and had a sense that bush was blowin smoke about weapons of mass of nothin
damn those french bastards happy bastille day everyone
the shakers say it is a gift to be simple and a gift to be free
simple gifts is an old shaker song written in 1848 and it is one of my favorites
it is a song about simplicity but it also says that when we find ourselves in the place just right we will be in the house of love and delight
while the house of love and delight sounds like a cheesy incense burning hippy joint the sentiment is what gets me
i like the idea that when we are true to ourselves we will find the simplicity of life which ultimately brings peace
but its not always so such a simple gift
we are all given gifts to some degree
we are can run companies we can cook amazing food we can play an instrument we can balance budgets we grow a garden we can teach someone to read we can diagnosis symptoms we can write we can act or we can see the world differently through the lens of a camera
we all have talents and gifts which should be a part of our everyday lives
the act of doing what you are good at what you are talented in is itself simplicity and freedom
she has an eye like no one ive seen
she loves taking pictures of things like rust and wood
she can take scenery and portraits but these are not her specialty
those shots are easy and generic anyone can do them
the passion she sees through her lens are things we would easily pass over
hones in on the things that we feel corrode of corrupt surfaces
finds the beauty in them and she shows rust and corrosion as art
and she does it so well
she has never sold a photograph and has pretty much stopped taking pictures creatively when she left college
all because the cost of taking and developing pictures is too much for her budget
im saddened by this and i tell her often that she has to start taking pictures again that she has to use her gift
it is a gift to be simple and a gift to be free and sometimes we have to fight to use those gifts
if our favorite writers and actors and doctors and teachers didnt use their gifts where would we be how many times has your life been changed by someone elses gift i know that b
is scared and i understand it
putting your creative self out for the world to reject is a terrifying thing
but that simple shaker song says that when true simplicity is gaind to bow and to bend we shant be ashamd to turn turn will be our delight till by turning turning we come round right so bow and bend b
simply use your gift youll turn round right
two weddings down three to go
the other day i received yet another wedding invitation
as i perused the oh so familiar oversized envelope i wondered who the hell is getting married now i thought i was aware of all the weddings for this season
apparently now but i was relieved to find out it is a second cousin
im not close to her so the pain of another wedding was lessened at bit
it would actually be fine if i didnt make it to this one
but it is in florida in september
either that would be a great time to get a last minute tan or to see the wrath of a fabulous hurricane since it is the beginning of that season
i dont know if ill go
it would really be a weekend of hanging out with the rents which lets face it i do enough of in my own apartment when they decide to come visit often
i am however quite happy for this cousin as it is her second time of engagement though the first for actual invitations
shes in her late thirties and that alone gives me a bit of hope and room to breathe
tonight was a great wedding
the drinks flowed and good food was served and we ate dinner overlooking a lake at sunset
there were people ive never seen before and familiar faces from all the showers and preparties
there were good friends and new friends and family
and there was dancing and pictures and smiling and happiness and love lots of love all around
starting at 3pm in a catholic church i nestled in to back row pew and beckoned friends to follow suit
our row full of teachers was the official peanut gallery
we could hear and eye everything from out backseats the late comers the whispers the crying children the brat child telling her mother to shush we saw it all and yet we kept quiet
not being catholic we were worried that this would be what my dad likes to call and aerobics class service
you know up down up down kneel up down kneel etc
but my good friend l
decided on a catholic light service since they too are catholic light if anything
the wedding was short and pretty with wellchosen songs and readings
i always love big cathedral parishes they almost make me want to be catholic
i go to so many weddings that i could probably recite the scriptures and the vows by heart but this wedding did not bore me and when l
walked down the isle with tears in her eyes i kinda welled up myself
im not a crier at weddings
in fact i thought for a long time that i had a stone heart because of my lack of crying at weddings
everyone else gets caught of in the emotions and you see women dabbing their eyes and bridesmaids pulling kleenex wrapped about their bouquets
ive never needed a kleenex at a wedding and have always though yeah its a wedding whats the fuss why are you crying but today for l
i understood a little more
shes almost 31 and the tears in her eyes were the symbols of her waiting so long for that man who loves and respects her and that she in turn loves and respects
hes not a perfect man but he is one with whom she can share a life and so she cried for all that she is getting as she walked toward him
and when i saw her crying walking with her father i thought of myself and if i ever find that man im sure then that my stone heart will certainly melt and tears will run down my face as i walk toward him too
may you live happily ever after
so i havent been great at blogging lately especially since i returned from vacation
i even wrote those beach ones on vacation when i was up late at night and bored
but now back at home there are things to distract me
i should be writing all day since i have no job but i picked up a few kids to consult on and tutor so that takes up a few hours a week and then well today im just procrastinating
i have my final paper due for a class that finished on tuesday night
the paper was actually due tuesday but she gave us an extension and i took it
i am the worst procrastinator
i will put things off until it is 2 hours to deadline but this stress is really what gets my creativity and productivity going
ive tried to be diligent and work on things early and it is so lackluster that it seems a waste of time
ive tried to put my own deadlines on things to make me work on it and then go play but no again i dont fall for my own tricks
so today i probably should have turned it in sometime this morning but she didnt give us a time and so i havent started
but now now im getting ready to start
it should only take two hours or so unless i read some blogs or turn on the tv or have to call that friend back or have to find that cd thats been missing for 3 months because only that cd will make me productive
anyway off to work on it wink
i met him two weeks ago before i went to the beach
ive been thinking about him ever since and am so happy when i see him
he lights up my face and makes me feel like i have the best life in the world
ive even met his family and they are amazing
he has a brother and sister and his dad his handsome and his mother is kind
they are calm and centered and welcoming
on monday his mother gave me five ears of corn just because
it doesnt matter what i write because you cant possibly get the full scope of him
he has wisps of blond hair and blue eyes and when he says my name i melt
his personality shines even when he is in a different room
he is sweet and cuddly and playful and so much fun
and the reason that he lights up my day and makes me want to appreciate everything that i have is because he cant walk because of a tumor on his spine and he has cancer and downs syndrome and hes four years old
he deserves to live until he is 80 years old with a life filled with happiness and productivity and good people all around him
he deserves so much this little one this boy that i met
when you hit morehead city limits you know you are at the beach
windows are being rolled down and the warm musty salt air begins to hit your face
your hair begins to curl almost instantly
you know good grits are on their way too because beach water makes the best grits
you cross the bridge over the bogue sound and see a glimpse of that magical water part lake part ocean part river all saltwater and controlled by the tides
there are clams and oysters and sand dollars and porpoises in this water too and you wish you were staying on the sound
at the light after the bridge you take a right toward pine knoll shores just a few miles away from atlantic beach from you childhood
the house sits in front of the ocean facing what seems to be an endless amount of water
you cant believe there is actually something beyond the point that your eye cant see
the horizon is so far away that you see whole clouds from top to bottom in the distance
some nights there are storms at sea you see the lightning but the rain and thunder never make it to shore
you wonder what good a storm at sea does were any boats caught in it some days the wind is so strong on the beach that you have to stay in or go to the inlet or to fort macon or a day trip to beaufort
some days there is no wind and the heat comes off the sand like it is willing you to leave
some days the rain comes in at lunchtime and moves you from your saltwater post
everyday you want more more sand clinging to your toes more saltwater up your nose
the ocean pummels and turns you out
you keep going back to it
in low tide there are tidal pools a short distance from the dune
there is enough seawater to float you on a raft and as the tide is leaving there are enough waves to keep you moving
the tidal pool is the best of all worlds no thought of a rip current and all the luxury of on calm nights the moon glows in the sky so bright that the reflection off the water mimics daytime
you swear you could see by it
you know that nighttime is the best time on the beach
the beach is yours then because no else ventures to the beach at night
you sit on the deck and look at the horizon or the shape of the moon
you feel like you have a secret that no one else really wants to know about
how could anyone not love the beach more at night you dont understand the fascination with the daytime the sun and the rain when the nighttime brings the moon and crabs and loggerhead turtles
you know the secret and though you try to share it others prefer sleep
soon you must leave the crystal coast of north carolina
no other beaches in the world will compare
there is simplicity and elegance in north carolinas crystal coast
there are very few trappings of fancy dwellings or pools seamlessly flowing into the ocean
there are just beach houses many are old and some are new or just well kept
but the house isnt important its the beach the matters
its the weather and the sand and the promise of good shell hunts
its suntans and bathing suits and rinsing off before you come inside
its a morning swim then lunch then back again then dinner out
its beach towels draped over the deck at the end of the day
its the days catch on the pier or at the surf
its floppy hats and sun visors and sunscreen and big umbrellas
its rafts and buckets and shovels and sandcastles
its enduring the grit of the sand and the stickiness of the water
its the oldies station on the radio and its your family all around
its the beach in north carolina and part of you doesnt ever want to leave
a rental for a week for your family but a house to someone else
the evidence of the family who owns the house is all around
the selection of beach reads on the bookcase in the hall a small sampling of games with missing pieces in the living room pictures of the grandpa who worked his whole life to buy the house artwork from local artists and the choice of curtains that dont match the furniture
you enter a rental house like you enter a hotel
you know it is not yours yet you will treat it is such for the next week all the while ever thinking about the family who calls it our beach house
there have been houses that dont lock things away
the fishing pole of the grandpa who bought the house when he retired hangs on the wall beckoning you to use it
so youre father does and on the first cast into the ocean he breaks it
its too bad the original grandfather is dead or your father would have apologized to him
your whole family is a bit embarrassed but your mothers friend who rented the house said we were free to use the poles so your guilt is lessened a bit
still too bad about ole granddad
there are the houses that seem to want to share the experience with you
they leave out a guest book and brochures about the area
there have been visitors from as far away as ohio or as close by as new bern
your brother calls the travelers from new jersey and new york yankees
you call them yankees too but not out loud
they tell stories of their weeks how much their family loved the house the good weather they were fortunate to have and they note their favorite restaurants
you wonder why they choose to write what they write
the guest book is quaint but you are happiest about the tide chart on the bulletin board now you can start your vacation
exploring the house you cant believe that people share their space so openly with others that they will never meet
the coffeepot and spoons and beds and pillows and sinks and bathtubs and deck chairs and lamps are all communal property
there are fragile things about and when your niece knocks over a lamp and it shatters feel sorry for the family again but then you think that the owners expect these things beach houses are for children too
you wonder how all the house was stocked
did the owners really like the dark dense fabric on the overstuffed couches or was the whole ensemble on sale did they pick up the appliances at a thrift store or are the leftovers from the family 1970s orange kitchen your family discusses the flaws in the house in the decorations
they have ideas on how to make it better what to paint or how to arrange the furniture
you are quick to remind them that it is better than any of their beach houses
oh yeah they dont have beach houses
some houses have a washer and dryer and this is a luxury
you do a million loads in one week more than if you were at home and partly just because you can
you go home with clean clothes this you realize is quite nice
other houses have a linen service and beds are made for you and towels are provided
you feel a bit pampered by this but youd rather have the washer and dryer back
there are houses with air conditioning so strong you end up with a stuffy nose going from hot to cold to hot to cold
there are houses where your family breaks the ac and has to have the unit replaced midweek
you are again a bit embarrassed but realize you are just helping with the maintenance of the place
then there are houses with no air conditioning at all just ceiling fans and the hope of good ocean breezes
these remind you of camping in childhood
this is what the beach feels like to you heat cut by cool breezes off the water
days when there is no breeze you thank god for the invention of ceiling fans
it takes a good day to get use to the heat and the breeze but when you do you dont ever want air conditioning at the beach again
you sleep in little clothing and one sheet you like the simplicity of this type of house
in your mind you are always building the perfect beach house
it is oceanfront with enough bedrooms to house you immediate and extended family
it is not new it is old and well worn and there is a lot of wood
the oceanfront deck is partly covered and partly open to the elements
there are rocking chairs and a hammock
there is a table for eating and playing cards
a walk stretches to the dune where just before the stairs begin there is another small deck with seats built in and a shower hose for rinsing off
the house has most of its bedrooms on the first floor
upstairs at ocean view and deck level there is a family room and kitchen and dining room in one space
there are many large windows
the dining room table is big enough to sit 12 and there are folding tables for extra company
you want your whole family here and you create a space that allows for it
couches in the living room turn into beds
there is a good stereo with speakers throughout the house and the deck
oldies beach music is always on
every bedroom has a wellmade ceiling fan and can be closed off to the rest of the house so that windows can be opened at night
there are beach chairs on the deck and in the garage waiting for the sand
they are wooden with cloth backs
there are rafts and lifejackets and paddleball sets and kites and bachi ball
the house is always full of people
they wake up early in the morning to play together
they are little girls with smocked dresses and bows in their hair
they run around with highpitched voices learning to share the toys they have brought to the beach to a family vacation
little girl cousins are a special thing
they are automatic playmates and best friends
they share genes and are beginning to share their lives their growing up
they clamor to the beach with all their might they play in the sand for hours filling buckets dragging water from the surf and hunting for shells
they are adorable in their bathing suits and their skin tans easily even through super strength sun block
their fathers or mothers take them into the water and hold them safely from the waves
the tidal pools are a perfect depth
rafts are their best toys but sometimes it is just their hands and the sand and saltwater
they get dirtier than they have ever been and never seem to notice the grittiness the stickiness
they dont want to go into the house even after hours of playing but they love to rinse off with the hose a semi grown up shower for a little girl
watching your nieces you relive your cousin time at the beach at salter path family campground on the bogue sound
your playground was the sound and your favorite things were floating on a raft on the calm water and clam digging
you and your cousins where obsessed with shells
you hunted them tirelessly throughout the days on the beach or at the inlet at the north end of the island
at the end of the shell hunts you surveyed your treasurer
you memorized the shapes and names the olives and whale eyes and baby cradles and cigarettes
it is years later that you realize browsing through shell books that some names were made up by your mothers sisters
the next morning you woke up early to set up shop
you took boxes your mothers had packed in turned them upside down and laid old towels on top
you set out your shells by the side of the road in the campground
you sold seashells by the sound
you were thrilled with every purchase
after a few days of selling you and your cousins and mothers would walk the path of the campground to the real shell shop near the main road
you were amazed with the polished shells
you bought cleaned sand dollars and goldrimmed hermit crab shells and rope bracelets
your cousin still loves shells and houses them in glass jars in her home
you dont need them around you anymore but when you see shells or revisit the beach or see little girl cousins playing you wish for the days at salter path for the shelling and sound
you wish for you cousins and you hope the new cousins will long for their beach days and each other when they are older

a and also feel my pain wrap wedding presents for l and for s because l is already a mrs
and i need to give ss present to my parents this weekend email about bach
party for k because invites need to go out soon and we dont even know what city its going to be in i suck as moh aka maid of freakinghonor somewhere along the line when i cant take the stench anymore take a shower as you can see a busy day ahead
lets just see how much actually gets done
and no i have nothing else in my head to write about
ohmygod we have to go in
poor k has no idea what or who stuart weitzman is
sure she says and we enter
the store on rodeo is small yet two salespeople greet us at the door
they actually talk to us and welcome us and tell us about the sale
we have just come out of ralph lauren across the street where i found but did not buy a pair of purple leather mules on sale for half price at 495
i knew stuart could be much more affordable in department stores but i expect the rodeo store to have sales where shoes were still 200 300
every shoe on the sales rack is 75
hot damn i think i just might buy something on rodeo drive baby
k and i try on several pairs
i find some fabulous black satin high heels with an impossibly cute bow covering the toe
k finds some strappy white heels that she considers for her wedding day
we each buy nothing coming back to the reality that even at 75 a pair we dont live a stuart weitzman life
we leave the salespeople shockingly bidding us a good day
we are tired by this 2nd hour on rodeo
we have seen jos eber outside his salon a woman clutching her toy dog in chanel huge canary diamonds at van cleef arpels a rail thin blond model standing as a bored yet beautiful greeter at dior and the back private entrances to armani and gucci
we are heading toward the car parked in the sun in a free space in front of someones small bungalow and perfectly manicured green lawn
i am thirsty having downed my bottle of water noisily in gucci while walking among the fur trimmed dog beds covered in gs
we think we were done with the pseudo shopping and the mouth gaping staring and then all of sudden we walk across plexiglas ovals in the sidewalk
below the windows were human size ant holes with manikins ironing or just posing
there are three of them two girls one boy
what the hell i think
k and i look above us and there is no sign just a massive metallic rectangle as big as a mack truck above us
people are milling about in the opening to this store the entrance is set back and it is all open there are no doors but there are two huge human sculptures with no heads resting just under the ceiling
they seem to be holding up the second floor yet they dont quite touch it
k and i walk in we dont know what else to do we are transfixed
inside there are concrete walls and before us a massive staircase that spans across the room leaving narrow halls along either side
we walked down the left side and set into the wall there seems to be a concierge of sorts a young brunette manning a phone
is this a hotel i think
just past the concierges window there are low tables and set into the concrete walls are lit shelves at hip level
bags shoes just stuff covering everything but with no sense of order
i look closely at one of the bags and see the distinguishable triangle with the word prada
i turn k were in prada i gasp my face looking quizzical and amazed at the same time
we come around to the back of the room and there is another set of stairs mirroring the ones in the front yet opposite so that the staircases make a large triangle in the room
we decide to go up but have to navigate around shoes and the legs of manikins with no torso
what the hell keeps running through my brain
at the top of the stairs we turn left and enter a room that runs like small hallways just above the space below so that on the right and left are narrow halls and in the front and back are slightly wider rooms over the stairs
the walls are green and look like swiss cheese
but there are no smooth surfaces on the walls
i dont understand it and i follow ks hand to the wall
its plastic green plastic swiss cheese what the hell the rooms are created with the swiss cheese walls on one side and glass on the other to keep you from falling down the stairs
there are metal racks of clothes along the swiss cheese walls with exactly 5 items on each
thin tan bleach highlighted men in black walk around carrying an item or two
they are barely noticeable in this room the fade into theair
when we turn the corner and hit the larger front room i spy the dressing rooms on the right side above the stairs i see two little girls playing inside through the glass
i think i know prada is weird but who tries on clothes behind glass in front of strangers then one of the girls hits something on the wall and the glass goes frosted
hell after i touch some 1500 mini skirts we leave
k and i dont understand what we have just seen
was it real it will be the topic of many conversations with ks fianc that week and it will be the first story i tell friends when they ask about l
ill say im going to tell you about prada but you wont understand
and when im done telling them about the swiss cheese walls and the frosted glass theyll say things like weird or are you kidding and ill tell them that yes it sounds weird but you still dont understand
you really have to go
you have to experience it
go to prada on rodeo
its worth the plane ride
i used to collect quotations
id culled them from quotation books or magazines or friends or even the daily email from oprahs website
id write them in a flowery printed journal in my best handwriting
i wanted to the believe the lines like keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see the shadow but helen keller never saw a shadow though she lived within one
i wanted her words to show my how to not only look at the sunshine but surpass it and become it
she did why couldnt i for years my favorite quote was we are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars
when i found it i thought oscar wilde was my soul mate that he understood my plight
i even wrote it in fancy scrawl across a painted wooden board that held a curtain rod and hung it over 2 different bedroom windows
but looking at the stars does nothing for trying to reach them and if you dont come out in the daylight the gutter must be a hot and miserable place
you must do the thing you think you cannot do wrote eleanor roosevelt and she was right
you must in fact do the thing you think you cannot do
she was strong and brave and i trusted her words
she was the original nike slogan just do it
these words pulled me through many papers and exams in college but nothing nothing in college or life could prepare me for what lay ahead
my first years teaching i was energetic and nave and ready to take on the world
i loved what i did and felt absolutely called to do it
i thought that my teaching kids with autism was who i was
i thought it defined me and that everyone should revere me for the work i did
those first years threw me into a tailspin of hatred and anger and bitterness and disappointment and fear and illness
i complained constantly and to anyone who would listen but friendships and life were slipping away
quotations and words of wisdom wouldnt pull me through and there were many nights i just cried and prayed
i finally sought help and through a counselor learned that my life was full of unhealthy patterns and that i was the only one in control of what could happen in my life
i didnt believe her and for 3 years cried and complained about all the things that happened to me
then i began to use her advice and let the control go
i had to learn to let go and forgive
i had to learn to let life take me where it would
i had to learn to do the thing i thought i could not do
i faced the shadows and the gutters and im still learning to leave them where they are in the past
you cant see the sunshine or stars clearly until you face their opposites
and no one and no quotation will help you truly get there
they can point the way but you you have to do the digging and nail biting eye to eye combat with all the bad things before you finally appreciate all the good ones and let happiness if not land at least aim at your doorstep everyday
well this is a stretch for me mrs techchallenged 2004 i must be out of my mind to start this but then again i have been called crazy more than once in this life i dont know how much ill have to share so bear with me i know that i will try not to be unfair to any person in my scope of friends and will not spread gossip or slander anyone i only hope i will have something meaningful to say on occasion
wish me luck kc in fla
once again for your giggle gene my friday funny
have a laugh my friends its better that a pill this i know a little about lol nbspnbsp as nbspi nbspmature
as i mature ive learned that you cannot make someone love you
all you can do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in
nbspnbspive learned that no matter how much i care some people are just assholes
nbspive learned that it takes years to build up trust and it only takes suspicion not proof to destroy it
nbspive learned that you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes
after that youd better have a big willy or big boobs
nbspive learned that you shouldnt compare yourself to others they are more screwed up than you think
nbspive learned that you can keep vomiting long after you think youre finished
nbspnbspive learned that we are responsible for what we do unless we are celebrities
nbspnbspive learned that regardless of how hot and steamy a relationship is at first the passion fades and there had better be a lot of money to take its place nbspive learned that 99 of the time when something isnt working in your house one of your kids did it nbspive learned that the people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon and all the less important ones just never go away
nbspnbsppass this along to 5 friends
trust me theyll appreciate it
who knows maybe something good will happen
nbsp thanks nbspjanine have a great day love kc
my day off which means house work
god i hate itnbsp i usually work until 1030 on tuesdays so the hubby is home alone with the kids
which is all right hes great with them but more often than not the house winds up getting trashed while he is watching cnn in the bedroom then i have to clean up the aftermath grrrrr nbspnbsp i dont think that its fair that the one day off during the week that i would normally use as my time i
websurfing gardening reading errands etc
should be taken up with cleaning the house for the second time in the week sunday is my cleaning day top to bottom i work all the rest of the time
i just did this shite 3 days ago there are 5 people in this house damnit why am i the only one that thinks toys all over the livingroom and 10 dirty glasses strewn around are upsetting socks everywhere and hey a pair of size 4 toddler undies under the coffee table jeez what happened last night or do i want to know nbspnbsp what is that old comercial calgon take me away
all right i know its been a few days since ive been here the truth is i didnt have anything of interest to say
that is until i logged on last night and read the news
nbsp a new man is now at the helm of island records
at first i thought so what just another corporate wonk to annoy all of us lep fans
but after reading the article 3x might i add ive come to some conclusions
agree or disagree in my comments i love a good debate nbsp 1 he seems to have come up the ranks from d
this to me says he is a music lover as opposed to a businessman accountant papershuffler you all get my drift right nbsp 2 the fact that ofnbspall the established artists that are managed by island he specifically mentions dl in the article makes me have hope nbsp 3 the release of llwtg finally better late than never perhaps
but if he liked the song alone wouldnt he have released lionel richies version after all that would be promoting a record which has just been released as opposed to one that has been concidered dead in the water for a while now
nbspnbsp now i know that i may be blowing smoke here but i cant help feel that this is a good sign for the days to come
and the fact that our beloved guys are eligible for the rr hall of fame as of 2005 you all know how i feel about that and if you dont see my tag line on the forums having someone like him at the helm of the ship may just mean smoother waters ahead for our band
nbsp jmho and youll forgive me if i hope that im right on this one cheers all kc
nbspnbspnbspnbsp give me a sense of humor lord there is the story of a pastor who got up one sunday and announced to his congregation i have good news and bad news
nbspnbspthe good news is we have enough money to pay for our new building program
the bad news is its still out there in your pockets
while driving in pennsylvania a family caught up to an amish carriage
nbspnbspthe owner of the carriage obviously had a sense of humor because attached to the back of the carriage was a hand printed sign
energy efficient vehicle runs on oats and grass
cautionnbspnbspdo not step in exhaust
people want the front of the bus the back of the church and the center of attention
somebody has well said there are only two kinds of people innbspnbspthe world
there are those who wake up in the morning and say good morning lordand there are those who wake up in the morning and say good lord its morning
a minister parked his car in a noparking zone in a large city because he was short of time and couldnt find a space with a meter
nbspnbspthen he put a note under the windshield wiper that read i have circled the block 10 times
if i dont park here ill miss my appointment
when he returned he found a citation from a police officer along with this note
ive circled this block for 10 years
if i dont give you a ticket ill lose my job
nbspnbsplead us not into temptation
a father was approached by his small son who told him proudly i know what the bible means his father smiled and replied what do you mean you know what the bible meansnbspnbspthe son replied i do knownbspnbspokay said his father
so son what does the bible mean thats easy daddy
nbspnbspit stands for basic information before leaving earth
there was a very gracious lady who was mailing an old family bible to her brother in another part of the country
nbspnbspis there anything breakable here asked the postal clerk
the minister was preoccupied with thoughts of how he was going to afternbspnbspthe worship service ask the congregation to come up with more money than they were expecting for repairs to the churchnbspnbspbuilding
nbspnbsptherefore he was annoyed to find that the regular organist was sick and a substitute had been brought in at the last minute
the substitute wanted to know what to play
nbspnbspheres a copy of the service he said patiently
but youll have to think of something to play after i make the announcement about the finances
during the service the minister paused and said brothers and sisters we are in great difficulty the roof repairs cost twice as much as we expected and we need 4000 more
any of you who can pledge 100 or more please stand up
nbspnbspat that moment the substitute organist played the star spangled banner
nbspnbspand that is how the substitute became the regular organist give me a sense of humor lord give me the grace to see a joke to get some humor out of life and pass it on to other folknbsp nbspnbspnbsp have a great weekend folks ill try to post some more tommorrow lep hugs kc
i know i havent been here lately but i had a good reason
lightening hit the power pole in back of my house which took out our power amp cable

ok im gonna get off this thing for awhile before this moniter winds up being a lawn ornament tata for now
or pissed or whatever i got home last night from work and immediately my hubby got in my face why didnt you make the car payment i did i mailed the frigging thing fridaythe 2nd
well they havent got the darn thing yet it was due last saturday at the latest and i mailed it the day he got paid this bank i have my car loan through is supposedly a highly respectable institution but the problem is they are based in north carolina not florida the closest branch of this bank to me is 2 hours drive
they have a website but no payment options unless you have an account with them and you can not make a phone payment either unless your pymt
and this is the bank that the 3 biggest car dealerships in this area use for car loanswhy i can pay any of my other bills on lineover the phone with no problem
even my local water company will take payments over the phone podunk town that i live in but not this upstanding institution so now after talking with the rep from said bank i will wait until this friday and if the check has not been recieved they will call me and then take my payment over the phone
and i will have to pay the 30 fee to put a stoppayment on the check i sent or end up paying twice which i can not afford jeez this sucks off to throw a few pillows or something to vent kc p
i am still tying to get you all linked up i put the link section in but the sites i have entered are not showing
give me a little time to figure it out i will get it done
today my eldest is turning 14

shes the one who put up living with me no easy task i assure you in college

a talking frog goes into a bank and approaches the teller
he sees right away from her window nameplate that her name is patricia whack
miss whack id like to get a 30000 loan to take a holiday
patty looks at the frog in disbelief
in staying with the bnk policy pertaining to customer relations she kindly asks him his name
the frog says his name is kermit jagger adds the fact that his dad is mick jagger and that its okay to give him a loan because he knows the bank manager personally
patty explains that he will need to secure the loan with some collateral
i have this and produces a tiny porcelain elephant about half an inch tall bright pink and perfectly formed
very confused patty explains that shell have to consult with the bank manager and disappears into a back office
she finds the manager and says theres a frog at my window who says his name is kermit jagger he claims to know you says his dad is mick jagger and wants to borrow 30000 and he wants to use this as collateral
she holds up the tiny pink elephant
i mean what in the world is this thing youre gonna love this
the bank manager looks back at her and says

i hate to say it but life is getting back to normal
this is not to say that i have forgotten but life must go on
and i am doing this by trying to get some finances in order
we all know the best way to deal with things you cant controll is deal with those things that you can
and we all know i suck at finances
but microsoft money is my new best friend
i just stare at it
there must be a law agains having hours of fun looking at different pictoral representation of the same information
but it makes me happy
im such a loser right now
the highlight of my day is entering my credit card purchases and itemizing my paycheck
damn i need a boyfriend
well maybe later now its money for me
a boyfriend doesnt graph my expected net worth over the next decade
a boyfriend doesnt figure out how much of my amex payment goes to principle
a boyfriend doesnt keep you warm at night
maybe i just need to hook up with a cute accountant
so also on this weeks agenda was the acquisition of a certain cd
ben folds new album came out last tuesday and i didnt feel it was responsible of me to go buy it when the country was in turmoil actually i plum forgot but now i didnt
i love that boy and his wacky narrative lyrics
one of the songs seen below makes me so excited for when ill feel those things he talks about
it kicks my ovaries into overdrive
damn i need a man the luckiest i dont get many things right the first time
in fact i get told that a lot
now i know all the wrong turns and stumbles and falls brought me here
and where was i before the day i first saw your lovely face now i see it every day
and i know that i am
the luckiest what if id been born 50 years before you in a house on a street where you live
maybe id be outside as you passed on your bike would i know and in a wide sea of eyes
i see one pair that i recognize
and i know that i am
the luckiest i love you more than i have ever found a way to say to you
next door theres an old man who lived to his 90s then one day passed away in his sleep
and his wife she stayed for a couple of days and passed away
im sorry i know thats a strange way of telling you that i know we belong
that i know that i am
how do we move on now how do we live we must endure and we know we will but how i believe that the majority of us feel that some sort of war is eminent
maybe so but where does that leave us civilians how do we support our country in our greatest capacity
i work in a part albeit small but vital of defense
but being such a new member to this group am i better suited for a military position i spoke with a friend of mine and she shuttered at the idea although understanding my reasons
i mean how could you not
our beautiful country is hurting and she needs help
i only hope that i will step up and help her in the most productive facility in my power
so i have pondered whether the army corp
of engineers is the place where i could do the most good in backing our great nation
i am not the most physically adept person but i consider myself fairly intelligent and resilient
dont get me wrong im not running out tomorrow to enlist but i am considering it not as a career but rather as an aide to america in its time of need
how could i not when children are afraid of visiting grandparents and grown men are afraid of whats around the corner action needs to be taken and as weve been told it will be
i only hope that theyll take me i wont deny my sexuality but i do wish to help my country
im sure many homosexual americans agree with me in saying that we are hurting just as much as the rest of america contrary to what falwells recent interview on the 700 club may have referenced
obviously the future weeks will shed some light on this
i attended a candle lighting vigil tonight at the lincoln memorial and it was breathtaking
to see all those people grieving was incredible
to see thousands with candles is powerful enough but to see them with our nations capitol and most beloved memorials as their backdrop was immaculate
it was inspiring to say the least drawing upon those long since dormant feelings of patriotism that we put in drawers for days marked on the calendar marked with stars well every day is marked with a star it just took a little pointing to notice them well the stars are out tonight
humor is my primary tool for dealing with various circumstances but it seems that humor fails me in response to todays events
i as all americans feel saddened and enraged but simultaneously guilty for having these feelings since neither i nor any of my closest friends and family members did not perish in these incidents
i have lived or in the case of northern virginia still live in all of the areas that were unfortunately ravaged and continue to have ties with their residents
thankfully my loved ones are accounted for i grieve for those who are not
perhaps the most frightening thing about the occurrence as a whole is the horrific beauty in its execution and efficacy
the poetic nature of the elements of the attacks chills me
todays date 911 already a pop culture siren of fright will ring more poignant in subsequent years
while use of united and american vessels as tools of destruction will forever seem oxymoronic for to me they will always mean peace and love
throughout the course of today i choked back tears mulling over how our dearest value freedom was literally and metaphorically removed when air travel ceased and as americans our wings were clipped
it is times like now and during tragedies such as this when i deplore my lack of faith but then i realize that i have faith not in a higher power but in my country and in the nature of its occupants my fellow americans
faith that i am living free and just no matter what transpires
faith that as an entity our reaction will be swift and faith that it will be just
i gain comfort in the fact that we shall endure and await the time when humor returns as my staple coping mechanism but until then i just dont feel like laughing
my love to all of you if tears could only repair the damage
warning if you know me and are friends with erica this is nothing new
this is something i wrote for my friend ericas site
but that was before i had one of my own
ehh shuttup im starved for material
do you ever come up with something out of the blue
and then analyze the crap outta how your brain made that connection well i do
okay ill lay it out for you
i have a problem with money
well it has a problem with me
i mean it hates me
soon after i make friends with the dead presidents they file for divorce and go live with another semmingly more fiscally responsible chap
and the main source of our irreconcilable differences resides on the street
see i have this car
a nice bloke sargent hughes is his name
but hes about 2 or 3 times what i can actually afford
i catch a lot of flak from people about this
maybe i deserve it but i just joke it off
so when people ask me if mommy and daddy hooked me up with the aforementioned cherry ride i respond with no it was an impulse buy
i went in for milk and came out with a tt and a chunky
they quickly get a perplexed look in their eyes and laugh nervously
but the point of all this is the strange neural connection
so i got to thinking
why dont people ever run to the store to buy a chunky
every once in a while youll get an i need a pack of cinnaburst or the occasional can we stop for kitkats even those 112 calorie tictacs get representaion
so why is it that the chunky falls into the role of the redheaded stepchild of the confection world
i mean if you smell it does it not engulf you in a chocolatey euphoria what do milky way and snickers have that poor chunky does not perhaps its the name would more people go out of their way for a svelty or a scrawny bar maybe its fear of that age old proverb you are what you eat
in this age of perpetual dieting maybe theres no room for such sweet morsals
atkins so next time youre in the express checkout lane behind some jackass who put both shitake and portabello mushrooms in the same produce bag in order to bypass that eversostrict 10 items or less rule look over at the chunky but dont buy it
instead go home and write it on next weeks grocery list in big block letters
i guarantee that you wont be disappointed
that square 2by2 package is cooler than the other side of the pillow
just some food for thought
or is it a marketing scheme cashes check for next car payment ps
does anyone even know what chunky tastes like i never had one of those mf bars
at least i know what my next pity purchase is
put down that krackle and pick up a crunch bar you commie swine my previous foray into the politics of candy bars has led me to another of the industrys most heated debates
krackle hersheys answer to nestles eversosuccessful crunch bar or red propaganda aimed at american youth culture i heard at a party once that krackle was the most popular candy bar in the soviet union when it made its debut in 1978
actually i think i heard it from me i was in the mr
knowsomestuff stage of intoxication but since then too many coincidences have augmented my concern i dont mean to get all joe mccarthy on your ass but all im saying is if it looks like a duck
and talks like a duck
it must be a commie
heres a little history lesson on the subject of the beautiful merger of milk chocolate an puffed rice
nestle the premeire confectionist of perhaps the most historically neutral country on the planet switzerland introduced its crunch bar in 1938
since then this texturial fusion of silky brown and bumpy white sounds like a personal problem to me e has taken the bar candy industry by storm
hershey shocks the nation with their new treat
the timing here is key
the subversive reds would have observed a new generation
a guardless generation to which the red scare of the 50s was nothing but a beddytime story and indulgences such as disco and the hulahoop were waning in popularity making way for new guilty pleasures
the success of this bar was nothing remarkable to say the least due to the late entry into the market
krackle could not overcome the brand loyalty that crunchers as they prefer to be called have developed over decades
but did they care no
since its inception krackle has cornered two niche markets that target american youth
the first of these is holloween miniatures
what better way to distribute propagnda
the genius of this plan not only is exhibited by its success but also in the lack of the publics understanding of their role in the spread of communism in north america
its as if the archbishop of new york was distributing fliers for 12 price beer night at a chelsea gay bar while filled with a sense of warmth that he brought happiness to the public
the second market that krackle leads the way in is the coveted puffedriceandchocolategrammarschoolsalescontest market
need i say more now lets talk packaging
upon first look the red wrapper with white type may not seem too objectionable but it provides for the strongest of all arguments on the subject
its a little known fact that the original design for the wrapper had the word krackle in yellow but this was thought to be too obviously likened to the soviet flag
the broken text of the word is in itself extremely antiestablishment
coupling this fact with the blatent disregard for the arduous process of teaching youngsters to recognize the hard as well as the soft uses of the letter c rather acclimating them to the cyrillic alphabets lack of the aforementioned consonants versatility exhibits the coldness of their plan
even with all this convincing evidence hershey spokespersons continually refute these allegations and deny the existence of the scrapped workers of the world
so do with this information what you wish but keep your eyes and ears pealed for halloween is just around the corner
our program already in progress hello friends
i guess this first of all posts should begin with a little about myself
thats easy the names travis
im 21 on the brink of 22dom
i currently reside in the dc area
ive been here for about a month and i think ill keep it
im an engineer and im gay
i stand by my opinion that gay engineers make cool engineers whereas straight engineers make dorks
thats not meant as a dig to any of you
making fun of others just makes you feel better about yourself
there are some kickass notcompletelydevoidofsocialskills engineers out there
of the 14 on the east coast
a little background you ask okay
born and bred in suburban connecticut
shitty at times lovely the next day
i just had that one thing that made me a little different than all my friends
that one thing that i couldnt talk about for most of my life
but then dont we all
i dont mean to depict my sexual orientation as a sob story by any means
we all have our trials and tribulations and are strongerwiser for having experienced them
and dont get me wrong i had a loving supportive family conservative and religious at the crux but subsequently and possibly hypocritically supportive during my coming out
i had two older siblings the kind you love to hate and hate to love again typical
they are two of the most amazing people i know
i looked up to them so much in my life my neck is still sore
at times i couldnt stand them at times theyd make me cry but i wouldnt have it any other way
and now on to my final family member my secondary caretaker
i have this long standing opinion that nearly everything i know ive learned from tv
if you yield the power of that beautiful glowing box for good the world is your oyster
well maybe not that much but as martha would say its a good thing
early in my childhood i discovered no not men that came a little later movies
thank god i was born when i was cause the vcr shaped my life
look upon this as you wish but i believe it was genuinely good whenever you talk to a gay person well at least most of the time
they always say i always new i was different
which is our way of saying even before i got erections from mtvs the grind go eric i knew somethin was up
so in order to escape those alienation feelings i entered what i have since dubbed my celluloid closet
was it healthy maybe not but it got me through a lot of years when i wasnt ready to face myself
people often wonder why they didnt know
to a certain extent so do i but i sure as hell didnt want them to figure it out
is this why there are so many homosexuals in hollywood is it because we all grow up as actors well i played the part well
i didnt go as far as to submerse myself in athletics but i have gotten to the point where i cant tell if things i like are mine or my covers
im like charlie baltimore in the long kiss goodnight or am i samantha caine take music for one do i really like metallica or was that just my psyche trying to compensate my seemingly feminine condition with more masculine characteristics well i am 1 year out of that closet and this sort of self discovery is going to continue for a little while
maybe thats why im starting this
but i highly doubt it cause i predict that the majority of the posts will be of a random nature as an outlet for the funny that courses through my veins
so heres two for ya
and they continue to be bad
your blessing is no more than being safe and sound for the whole lifetime
you are cautious in showing your true self to others
so not only am i restricted from giving blood but i am boring and fake as well
line up fellas i start giving numbers at noon
i have to stop eating chinese food
if you could live anywhere in the world where would it be me id live in mike greybeals pants
oh no bad thoughts at work
i had a lot of fun this weekend
on saturday a coupla friends and i went to a dc101 radio station in our nations capitol holloween party
it was pretty cool we didnt dress up or anything but we all wore leather pants
i mean theres really no occasion otherwhen in the year to encase yourself in treated and dyed animal flesh so you gotta take the opportunity when it arises
anywho it was fun and i got trashed
but i was ferris beulering everything
i few hours into the party we were on the dance floor and some guy was carrying chicken to the vip room
i made and ooh ooh noise and pointed
so he stopped came back and let me swipe a piece
i dont know who that kind soul was but i was never the same after that moment
and then i thought things couldnt get better i had just scored some compfowl and there was a disco band that was really kickin
i go up to the band to try to request some jackson five a jender and t staple when dancing but struck out no motown he says
try the dj he says
well it was a big neg from the dj too actually i think he said yes but i didnt hear it cause
so im on my way back to my friends when i see giligan trying to get into the vip room and the bouncer stopped him
meanwhile i look all official coming from the dj booth and everything so i call out no thats giligan let him in
in the wake of my thrall the bouncer bends to my desire
then i just walk in
now ive already had 5 beers at this point and there was free shit in vip bad combo for the tster
so i try to contact jender via cellular technology but nothin thankfully they came in a little later when the bouncer stepped away for a pee break
meanwhile im sitting around with all these radio people and i see giligan and hes like dude you got me in
and im like go me so i end up talking to diane from the elliot in the morning show for like and hour
it must really suck to be them cause they live hours of their lives in the public eye and it must be taxing how everyone they talk to thinks theyre like bestest frinds cause they ease the morning commute
but back to me i down like 5 more beers and travis is kicked
so i pile up a plate of wings and we head for the metro
now this is where i forget everything
i remember vaguely getting on the metro and making a fool of myself while i was on it
i was told that i was telling everyone to get off cause swank was too sexy
thank god for nordstroms cause i strapped the handles of a shopping bag on my ears like a feed bag and yakked all the way from vienna back to jenders
all in all i had a blast until sunday morning
but all yall know what thats like
well i eat too much chinese food you make people realize that there exists other beautise in the world
which to me means youre gonna die alone you ugly bitch and drive all hot men into the arms of other hot men
i think i should stop reading these things cause autumn pessimism is setting in
cause i can make anything sound bad like if i get youre going to come into a large sum of money ill translate it to youre gonna die alone you ugly bitch and the only thing that will have sex with you will be cold hard cash
just kidding im not really this bad
fortune cookie our first love and last love is
my sister tried to convince me that it meant you love yourself and in doing so better yourself in order to love others but i believe it meant your gonna die alone you ugly bitch
so i got trashed this past friday at my friends
we watched old monster movies and carved pumpkins
i forgot my pumpkin but ill get it tomorrow
anyway it doesnt matter it looked like marv albert
solely because of the mouth
just saving face cause even the cute dimple on mine couldnt salvage the gourd as a whole anyway the next day she and i and a new friend swank went to six flags in md
it was a lot of fun and a beautiful day
but i wanted to hurl the whole time
we were in line for the batwing right and swank was all i dont wanna go on
hear the people screaming so jender was like theyre just happy and i was all theyre screaming for charo
it was really funny at least to me in my diminshed brain cells state
so after dropping a jackson at random games around the park i won back to back rollaballs and acquired a stuffed aligator named charo coincidence
there are two things i dont believe in
come to find out charo is actually a transvestite and his real name is ken adams hows that for twilight zoniness well incubus new cd comes out tomorrow so pick it up
i tend to order a lot of chinese food so ive decided to put up my favorite fortune cookie wisdoms whenever i encounter them
my sister got this one last week and i assure you this is verbatim complete with exclaimation point alas the onion you are eating is somebody elses water lilly
so birthday wishes to me
its 10 oclock and ive already received calls
im just hoping that nobody calls tonight during buffy
so im doing nothing today
damn i really have to get on the ball with this apartment thing but i just like having a little cash on hand ya know
but then i need to make friends
so i tend to start every paragraph with so
thats what i do when i have nothing of import to say
youll be happy to know that my gum wrapper chain has gotten longer and i fortified every link with a little piece of gum so that it is stronger
these are the things i tend to do when bored at work
i hope that i can edit this later cause its sooo dull
forgive me friends for i have sinned
its been so freaking long since my last confessional
just a little bit of my catholic upringing reering its ugly face
it so weird how infused it is into my life being that im like mr
i was having a personal problem last week
i couldnt find my deoderant
i knew it was around somewhere cause its not like you pick it up and walk around the house with it
ya know you use it and put it right back
well i was in my room yesterday and i saw my life insurance policy on my table and it hit me
boy did i feel dumb
i was like salt and pepper my face cause it makes the egg taste better
but the funny thing is since ive received my policy ive been more at ease that my loved ones will be taken care of if i
and by loved ones i mean my car so deoderant was not as necessary
i just marvel at the poetic nature of the snafu
but now im fresh and smelling nicely
so take comfort in that
why cant the desire to fuck be transitive i was pondering this on the shitter
since there is a mirror right there
i was looking at my new highlights
and i quite like them now that ive showered
im mean one of the benefits of being gay is that im my own demographic
i was like if i came up to me and hit on me i would be receptive
therefore it goes to reason that i would hit on me
i think i achieved fourth person there so lets take a for instance
hes this dude that was on undressed for a few episodes a major beauty on the hot scale
so on a given day lets say tuesday id have sex with him
now if we couple this with the above id have sex with me then geometry would dictate that he would have sex with me
but then i got to thinking you throw in a girl who has bisexual tendencies who is attracted to me then id have to want to have sex with her
and this just throws a wrench in the whole rigmoroll
so i have tucked the transitivefuck theory in a drawer with my other thwarted thoughts like i deserve to be wealthier than the crocodile hunter and with all the grapenuts in the world why is there still hunger well bye now
i had this weird dream last night and im pissed that i cant remember the haiku that was in it
cause it made me laugh
well as much as a sleeping person can laugh
i havent put anything new up here in a while
i was watching tv last week and i hit rock bottom
fox showed the eversoenthralling who wants to be a princess it sucked
and i was stupider for having watched it
well there was one good part
when they were modeling and it showed their likes and dislikes
everyones dislikes were like mean people ignorant people dishonesty but this one girls was moth balls and hyper dogs
i wanted to jump in the screen give her a big smooch and hand her the crown
i laughed for like 10 minutes solid
but then i saw the prince and i was like im glad she didnt win
id rather hop on benjamin the results giver or as his resume would say special liaison to the judges
i think my funny went on vacay
i am sooooo tired today
i mean add to the fact that im sick i got like 5 hours of sleep
which for me is like none
if sleep had the right equipment id sleep with it daily
well i guess bed thoughts kinda supplanted sex thoughts today though maybe i am getting better
bad thoughts continue but now theyre all taking place in bed whereas before they were everywhere
ya know locker rooms prisons atop the seattle space needle the usual
jender and i just basically shot the shit all night and made fun of or more rarely complimented all the attendees
one woman was the undeniable reason that agoraphobia was created
the beer lady was a trip though
she was funnnny with a capitol fun
oh yeah and i got the play the didjeridu which was an experience
well im off to feign interest in my work as i contemplate my hopeful christmas gift of 600 thread count egyptian cotton sheets
betty so better be on the ball with that
i mean have you ever heard of such a thing
they are the bomb and not just like the cherry bomb or the smart bomb they are the hbomb
my sister already got hers and im green with envy
can my goddamn nose just stop running
egad its been forever since i updated this chippy
im sorry im quite delusional right now
im sick and kinda run down
im just sitting here at work waiting for my tea to steep so i can down a coupla dayquil
but the thing that sucks for me
well if i dont stay home is when im sick all i can think about is sex
im not sure if any of you suffer the same byproduct of sickness if you do let me know so i dont feel like such a perv
so it makes work that much harder so to speak
i sign out of yahoo mail and i see that ediets guy and im gone
an hour later were living in a townhouse with two puppies and a cockatoo his not mine i tried to convince him that damn bird wasnt worth it but hes one stubborn fag
its not so much of a one track mind but more of a one station mind where all tracks meet
and to top it all off i didnt win powerball last night
these are the things i have to deal with i mean how much can one person take im like two seconds from writing the lottery commission and saying hey
if i dont start winning im gonna stop playing
how do you like them apples look at me the little sicky weilding the iron fist
i mean how else are you gonna get results a vague disclaimer is nobodys friend
i hope i fell better and dont puke on any diplomats
who am i i hooked up with some kid last night
i think it was all about making myself feel better
i just returned to my alma mader and im all feeling old and shit
but i hope to have a fun fun weekend i just hope butter buns doesnt give me too much flak
god ive never done that sorta thing while other people were in the room visiting from outta town
thats it im officially a skank
im off to eat some really good chinese
i think i angered my brotherinlaw yesterday
ok my bad totally my room is getting a bit messy
well up until last night when i cleaned
so my sister called this morning and was like thanks it looks great
and im like huh great i just cleaned my room
its not like i made a chess set carved out of white potatos and sweet potatos that have been fried so that as you win you can eat frenchfried bishops and rooks and pawns
its not like i did that
i just cleaned my room
i drank like two pots of coffee this morning
consequently i thought i was going to puke so i went home after lunch
ironically i felt better once i got home what a kick
so i popped over to pier 1 cause there was this blanket i wanted to get and over to suncoast to get a cheesy homo pic
i never thought a movie could be this bad but enjoyable
i mean once you get throught the horrible story vomit inducing acting choppy editing and sickening soundtrack
it bit but the lead was hot so all is forgiven
im such a sucker for a pretty boy
well off to nap my half day away
so heres the latest cookie talk
its like you need a decoder ring to understand it
or you can be like me and excel at pisspoor english
wish you a good health i dont even know where to begin
at least its not bad
of all the fortune cookies ive ever read this is by far the most recent
i dont know why offices that dont have constant turnover like stores or factories have to be open
i think im totally not comming in tomorrow
so i made some changes to my template
i like it better i robbed some code from e cause ive become html ignant
but i cant find this freaking roll of film that i want to use as pictures
i guess ill just have to take some more
god i have no funny stories
my sister was telling me that yesterday she was riding the elevator with one of the partners of her firm
this guys like 50 and a partner in one of dcs largest law firms
he was talking to her about the weather and she was saying how it would probably not snow
so he was like partner do you ski sister i used to but now i just really like sledding
as if it wasnt enough that my sisters barely knee high to a puppy and looks about 12 now her favorite pastimes include sledding
last night she was kicking herself
this is a dream i had last week it was a nice day at the races
dog no horse no groundhog yes
so it was the finals of the national groundhog races and the favorite butterbuns was up against the underdog nicky
i wanted nicky to win cause i had a nickel on him
there was a little confusion cause nicky wasnt high in the polling system but he had won all his matches so a challenge was extended on butterbuns behalf but the judges ruled in favor of nicky
bb was dressed in a bumble bee outfit complete with fuzzy antenae
an obvious crowd favorite to nickys black jersey
and theyre off butterbuns took an early lead at 50m but nickey pulled it out in the last leg
so i took my 5 gs to the victory party and got completely smashed
it was a good day
even punxatawney phil came out but stardom has really gotten to him and hes been hitting the h a little too hard
so he just sits around and waits for february when the spotlight is on him
that prognasticating fuck hes nothing more than a glorified coin toss
well im back at work
fuck all you who arent
i hope everyone had a nice holiday weekend
okay i come from a catholic family but im an atheist so i constantly have a battle of what i should do
what is the least disrepectful to my family and what is the least disrespectful to their religion
i simply choose to abstain from most of it
i go to christmas eve mass but i dont participate
i basically just sit there and look around usually checking out boys but then i check myself cause thats not the place
but then theres grace and all the family talking about how nice the service was
but then we go to my cousins to eat
this is my dads side of the family very slovak
its fun but holy supper as it is called is very shiny
i dont know if you know about slovakian food but its all cabbage potato and lots and lots of butter
every year we sit down to a meal of saurkraut soup boiled potatos perogies cabbage and noodles kielbasa and kraut etc
then christmas day is when we get turkey and other american things
i scored some pretty good gifts this year
got the sapranos 1 2 sheets only 440 but ehh i cant stay mad at my mom dr
zhivago rogue leader two pairs of shoes a gamecube case and some other stuff
im like 22 and i still get lots of gifts
i talked to my grandfather this weekend on the phone for like 20 minutes
it was strange ive never talked to him for more than 5 minutes and even then it would be about computers
but this time it was about everything
apparently he has a girlfriend
well that just pulls my cork i dont know what it means but my nanny said it this weekend she so funny shes 85 and quite a firecracker i cant believe my 78 year old grandfather can get a girlfriend and i am boyless
but anyway he asked me if i had a girlfriend and im like ehhh no
its not like i think that he wouldnt approve or anything i just dont feel its necessary to tell all the old people until ya know im in a relationship that last longer than a week
i was psyched though i got off the phone with him and i turn to my brother and im like im his favorite
my brother was really funny this weekend though we got drunk yesterday and apparently he wants to be on saturday night live
im not sure if hes up for it but i think we come from some pretty funny stock
we talked until like 3 in the morning
i get to meet his girlfriend when im in nyc for new years
then before i hopped in my car to return to the nations cap we went over to my moms side very italian
but the ass grabbin didnt last that long i had to get on the road
recounting my holiday isnt much fun for yins
in the words of my baby cousin i dont wike tickows
this is not so much of a now epiphany but a remmberance of epiphanies past when i was like 4 or something my parents like many warm giving americans got sucked in my sally struthers and save the children
so we sponsored this little girl her name was pinky
which coincidentally became the name of my first goldfish making my porn name pinky washington
with a name like that id have to do porn as a tranni so for the longest time which was probably like a few months i thought that pinky was actually my sister and i couldnt figure out why she didnt live with us
i was such a ron of a tyke
also for a while i thought that the term rents as in im living with the rents was in reference to the fact that you should be paying rent not a shortened version of parents
for a smart guy im so dumb
fish and chips and chips and fish fish and chips and chips and fish fish and chips and chips and fish oh what a delicious dish i hate fish and chips but that just poped into my head for no reason
im drinking coffee for peepers sake
so i had sushi for lunch today and i was thinking
i gotta find a new thing to eat cause sushi although quite satisfying without the clogged poreenlarging thighs feeling of a bigmac is so last year
its somewhere between 5 minutes ago and out on the shaw report
i mean as far as food fads go its pretty good but when are we gonna have another badforyou food fad
why cant ben and jerrys come back into style
well without all the hemp accessories and plaid
in addition i believe i may have ended my boycott of artificial sweeteners
im drinking a diet coke oops i corrected it but that coke was originally a bad word
or rather a great word
finally i feel like i am actually comming into my own as a gay man
i mean who among the human race enjoys men and drinks exclusively straight up soda
i mean only heteros like sugar in the can
anyway im just a big goof today
well i hope everybody is having a good happy stacey day
its a day we invented cause my sister finished her last final 3rd year law school last night
her name is traci but i call her stacey sometimes
cause i have a bad memory
i had my first krispy kreme doughnut today
i cant believe ive been a kk virgin for 22 years
theres about a dozen more in the break room but i dont want anymore i think id be ruined for life not to mention this afternoon
last night i forgot to eat so im betting some time around 11 itll be go time and the more greasy the food is i eat the less pleasant the experience will be
tomorrow i head back to ct the land of commuters and bad beaches
but hell i love it
i cant wait to see all my friends
then its back here on tuesday and back to manhattan on friday only to come back here the following tuesday
im just a ping pong ball and the delaware memorial bridge is my net
well a happy happy stacey day to you all
my new favorite thing to do is pull up at a light next to a car turn up really loud music like system of a down or linkin park and make like im dancing to shiney happy people
people look at you so strangely
okay so i got to thinking you all know about my thoughts and my life but what about my subconscious so i decided to start this new segment call
cue dramatic music name that childhood trauma its about dreams and if you have theories on what my dreams are about let me know
okay so last night i had this dream that i was at a naval academy graduation not as a graduate but as a spectator
so i come up into the stands but im on the wrong side
sidebar i also had an ability to jump really high so i whip out 2 umbrellas one of which is inside out and pointed down and i jump really high and drift slowly towards the other side of the bleachers
it took about 4 jumps and every time i landed on a soontobe alumn i realize that theyre all people i knew from high school
so i finally get to where my family is and the admiral who is giving the key note speech said good job then the whole stadium erupted in applause
i have no idea either
i have no idea what is up with people today
elliott in the morning dc101s morning show was a veritable conucopia of nut jobs
for 30 minutes they talked to a 60 year old barber in rockville md who likes to wear a bra and fake 44 ds while he cuts peoples hair
so this fella luis dressed up and became luise i felt bad after a while cause they were going a little far but it was funny
but they were also pressing him about being gay even though he said he wasnt
i mean there is a difference between crossdressing and homosexuality
i thought that we all figured this out with j
and then afterwards some people in traffic called in and said that two girls with a camera were hanging out on the side of the road with a sign saying show us your twins
people are so nutty some times
i dont know if people actually obeyed their wishes but im sure it was a site to see
i wish that would happen when im in traffic cause i get so damn bored
anyway i think im now in love with nick hexum from 311drool
im gonna go fantasize now
oh yeah and if anyone has a life that they can spare ill give ya 50 bucks for it
so for lunch today a coworker and i went to the mall cause he had to get a present for his little cousin
while there and walking down the aisle i hear a punk kid when did i turn 65 say hey there goes the faggots
i look around to see who he was referring to come to find out he was talking about some uniformed military personnel
i was a little peeved i mean cmon
especially with all the crap going on show some respect
not to mention his use of the f word i mean when my friends say it to me its kinda funny cause i know that they love me but saying it in public
okay thats enough moral outrage thats not really what this site is supposed to be about
well anyway i bought the new 311 cd cause i like 2 songs
i have got to stop doing this
i mean i just got the system of a down cd too and i only knew 1 song
but whatever i think the 311 dude has a really sexy voice so ill probably enjoy the rest of it
i think i mainly pick my music cause i like the guys voice
i mean i rarely listen to female vocalists sometimes but not nearly as much as the fellas
is that wrong i ask you
i mean it doesnt have to be rip your clothes off sexy even just cute sexy
heres my cd changer line up right now 1 mix with dave matthews disturbed etc soon to be 311 2 pete yorn 3 gorillaz 4 incubus 5 linkin park 5 system of a down i mean and look at my past favs metallica travis coldplay rem ben folds alice in chains soundgarden tool the beatles limp bizkit michael jackson supergrass billy joel finger 11
not a hooha in the bunch
do i have a problem maybe but whatever
so atlantic city this weekend was a lot of fun
although i did only spend or waste what i had allotted i still come away more affluently challenged than last week
but i think it was worth it
on the trip up jender was a worthy companion while driving through baltimore jender look at the cruise ship me uhhh honey
thats the coast guard with conversations like that the trip was quite entertaining
it was a little chilly though walking from the hotel to and from ceasars my balls were brickass frozen
and along the miss america walk of fshame watching jender do the elbowelbowwristwristwrist wave was a hoot
but back at the sheraton bar we had a blast
broke and busted we whipped out the plastic and charged up a tab
the two bartenders were hot one with and one without a peeper and a lot of fun
and the live entertainment was at a perfect volume loud enough for you to be able to sing without bothering anyone but quiet enough for you to converse
throughout the night jender was requesting aka screaming mr
big but it never came but there was some good journey billy joel etc
i was all ugn scht ugn ahh during allentown
14 drinks and a hotashell order of chicken fingers later we ended the night
the drive back was eventful
i caught holy hell when both of us i might add missed the exit for the turnpike so we ended up in philly
j should we turn around t um i think we can pick up 95 in philly j you dont know where we are t hey we both missed the exit and we both drove here but i know 95 goes to philly so im pretty sure we can pick it up j pretty sure were lost you dont know where we are t yes i do theres philly if we dont hit 95 we can turn around j just cause we can see philly doesnt mean you know where we are t calm down j dont tell me to calm down were lost lo and behold we come up on 95 t see were okay
j laughing we fight like a married couple
so we made it home actually faster than if we didnt go through pa cause we didnt hit any stop lights
all in all a successful road trip
dear readers i brought my car in for service today
i think the guy was a little peeved that its like 7k past due
he got the mommydaddy bought that for you ya brat and you cant take care of it look on his face
meanwhile im scrimping and saving to make the payments shuttup
and if you get a chance could you check it out
i cant remember the last time i had any power
and im not talking sexual power or conversational power cause ive had that im talking social status power
oooh ooh i remember picture it connecticut 1989
my brothers team just won the little league world series in williamsport pa and im feeling a little unattended if you will
so as i enter the fifth grade i obtain the most coveted position an elementary school student could have bus patrol
cue eerie music not only did i get the fashonably blinding orange beltmiss america sash but i got a badge
okay i dont know about your neck of the woods but in our precinct the badges worked like this no trim patrol red trim sergeant walkers green trim lieutenant 1 per bus blue trim captain 2 per school so me and one of my friends who was my grade nemesis to my parents but i could give too shits about grades i havent come too far were the captains
captain horton and i ran the monthly meetings
in addition i had carte blanche for 20 minutes a day cause i was the first bus stop in the morning and the last in the afternoon
and at any time i could boss people around or even
sit in the back it was like the holy grail to single digit peeps
i loved it in the rear i definitly havent come too far
but as a fair an impartial emperor i joke i mean captain i joke i mean ruler i invoked the magna carta of bus 13 agreements okay lietunant cohen helped draft it i couldnt spell well damn im like the same person as i was 12 years ago just with better fashion sense and without the two inch lenses warping my nose forever
this agreement was an organized schedule that placed the 6 patrols in pairs a b and c on a weekly rotating schedule for sitting in the front middle and rear
this way if any of the yungsters had problems a patrol would be within 4 seats and also a patrol would always be in the emergency exit row
so as my brother was getting free trips to yankee stadium shea and fenway i was taking my anger out on 4th graders
especially that kid something weiner he was such a cock
oh to weild that sort of power again
okay im starting a new recurring entry type today
its for when i discover that ive been stupid for years thinking one thing when its completely false
heres a warmer i never knew that there was no such word as reoccurring
i tried using it in my earlier entry and checked my spelling and lo and behold not there
im sure e is like finally that fucking moron makes my ears bleed every time he says it
yeah i know how you are
and heres the real one okay just a few days ago i realized that on the monopoly board those are not ghosts in the community chest theyre bags of money
i always thought they were demented little ghosts with their beedy little eyes
now it makes sense ive always preferred chance and every time id pick up a cc card id be filled with a strange fear
check it out a see if you can see how my fucked up brain rorschached this
i think i have a tapeworm
again im freaking hungry from the word go
so i have moved into my antiparasitic mode
anything to get rid of it
im actually kidding here i dont actually think its true so water only for my uninvited cohibitant
last night i had a dream that i was at a concert and my baby got hit
hughes was all banged up i was quite distraught
i never actually got to see the moody blues
thats a recurring dream for me
going to a concert and not making it out of the parking lot for one reason or another but its usually cause of drinking drugs which i dont even use or other debauched activities
at least its not teeth falling out i hear thats about anxiety and it only makes me more anxious
so i bought pikmin for gamecube yesterday
its actually a lot of fun but kinda involved
those little guys are kinda cute and the little space man is awwwdorable
well see how it pans out
i hope ac goes well
i think im gonna buy a powerball ticket too
i read that it was my golden month so im hoping i can score big
actually e read it to me
it was in some summer issue in jane
but it did say id get a job in august which i did and get some lovin in october well my skank activity was in november but im a late libra so maybe
or maybe it means that im finally gonna buy abba gold thats what jender and i are gonna listen to on the way to sodom
well either way im happy
tonight is the finale of the amazing race and it has been a trip let me tell you
it seems like such a cool show to be on even if you lose you at least get to go to some cool places and do some cool shit
i dont know who i want to win though
team guido is way back thank god they give homos a bad name
so its between rob and brennan the hot lawyers and frank and margarita the separated couple i think my vote is for fm cause it looks like they may be able to patch things up and theres a kid involed in that relationship
i just hope those crazy kids can work it out
well it would help if frank would stop being abusive which to his merit he seems to have turned it around lately
but now that kevin and drew are outta it i dont care too much those guys were a laugh riot
im hungry or rather my flatworm cohort is but i think im gonna stall him until 1
sorry for the randomness of this entry
so did you watch 24 last night wow
this is what my life has been boiled down to
no really im just kidding
i think im just getting my interholiday bumms
well im really looking forward to ac this weekend thats atlantic city to the laymen mmmm
im planning on winning about 50grand
i mean give or take
ooh ooh i was thinking this the other day im always so positive when gambling
im all like im gonna win powerball im gonna rock at roulette ed mcmahon already has my number that ediets guy shops at my grocery store and were gonna get it on
ya know stuff like that
and then i get stuck with people comming up to me after asking how it turned out well low and behold im empty handed
so not only were my dreams dashed but fuckin people rub it in
one of these days im tellin ya im gonna win and nobodys gonna believe me
i know what youre thinking loser
well how bout i pop off one of your antennas and throw it across the yard
then whos the loser you or me but anyway im hoping im gonna be able to stick to my i have this much to play with and i cant lose any more
cause i think im highly susceptible to the fever
so i was peeing in the urinal yesterday when it hit me
i prefer street shopping in the winter
why you ask well heres my reason
in the winter when you street shop the natural light is dim making for highly reflective glare free store windows
and we all know about the expansive and contractatory i made up that word right properties of glass
so when the inside tempurature is warmer than the outside temperature it makes the inner plane of the window slightly larger than the outer plane thus creating a slightly concave surface
this makes you look thin and beautiful
generally panes of glass are taller than they are wide if you are walking past a store where the pane is wider than it is tall look away it will only make you look short
conversely in the summer you look fat
this is a variation on the hall of mirrors attraction at amusement parks
be forwarned that this is not always the case as some new windows are installed more snug than others to allow for settling and foundation frost heaving
i know what youre thinking damn that was a long pee
well your right i think i drink too much coffee in the morning
so then i shook it twice cause any more and id be playing with it and went back to my desk
so i think im getting stupid
some time last week i was on the phone in the back yard smoking when i finished my cigarette i proceeded to come inside
the sliding door was open so i just walked in
right into the screen door
my brotherinlaw still busts on me for that
a few days later i take another way home right to avoid traffic
so im driving down the street in the opposite direction from what i usually do and i notice that there are a lot of cars parked
so i pick a spot between two unfamiliar cars thinking maybe someones having a party
parallel park effortlessly it was great
then i get out and approach the door finally it dawns on me
wheres the huge mound and trees i was about a block short of my house so i stood there for a few minutes trying to decide weather to move the car or just walk finally i decide to move it
so i walk up to the door put the key in and guess what
i got all embarrassed and pissed then i realized that i just didnt put it in far enough so i went inside defeated
on a completely different topic i was watching trading spaces with my sister this weekend and vern was painting a room red the walls and the ceiling and my sister and i got to talking traci vern likes red
me vern really likes red
traci red is verns favorite color
traci vern really loves red
me verns gonna marry red
i really think some good points were brought up in that conversation so i thought id share
okay its been a while since ive put some of these up but i was waiting for some good ones
well first off when i was in pitt like ages ago if you recall this was the skank day i went out to eat with a coupla friends
and strangly enough we all got the same fortune prejudice is the child of ignorance
at least it wasnt bad and kinda informative
also the pitt delt me this one what makes an apple fall to the ground well im no physisist but this doesnt strike me as the brain buster its portrayed as
finally this weekend i got what experts believe is the best fortune ever you are almost there
shortly after reading this i did in fact arrive at a destination
so i was going to write today about how im getting stupid but thats gonna have to wait cause i am a genius
im sitting in work trying to figure out something to do and i get some coffee
it tastes really bitter and strong
so im like i wish someone could combine the manly bean flavor of coffee with the smooth leaf flavor of tea
so i steeped tea in already strong coffee
i cant decide whether to call it coffeete or teaffee
im telling ya this thing is like the closest thing you can get to opium yeah whatever like id know
im so high on caffiene right now
shut up little leprechaun man im trying to type anywho i emplore you all to give it a whirl but only if you dont have to drive for at least 6 hours
i think its gonna be the trademark drink at the daily grind
there is no way id get fda approval
i almost puked a little while ago and my heart is beating at an unprecedented rate
im through with teafee im glad i got that monkey off my back
on an unrelated note im looking forward to a weekend of drinking and debauchery
okay so i was walking in georgetown this past weekend and i was thinking
i should open a coffee house
id call it the daily grind
get it i think its cute in a quarky way
once i get that inexhaustible source of income im set
then you all can take a break from your daily grind and stop in for some coffee
i wouldnt be there though cause id have so much money i wouldnt be friends with the likes of you anymore
well heres to wishing ill never see your ugly mug anymore just kiddind
someone remind me never to drink tea in the afternoon
especially when its useasonably warm outside
god its like im having hot flashes
great like i need to have another reason im not going to have kids
like keeping my cell phone in my pocket near my buddies and smoking arent enough reason
not to mention the fact that all ovum are banned from sexual encounters involving me
well back to my desk
its cooler in that corner of the room anyway
so i really need to do something about how this looks huh well im lazy
so screw you but anyway i havent put anything up here in like a week
i cant think of anytrhing funny to write about
commence bitch i had a swift 2 hour commute in the morning blahhhh some 18 wheeler bottomed out
it was like someone took the two ends of it and snapped it like a popoid remember popoids i used to make popoid cars and pilot them with my weebles
so that was a pain in my tushie
then my evening drive to tysons to meet jender for a lovely dinner thai was trafficky too
and there was an accident on the way home from the mall
i completed the beltway in one day yesterday and it only took 4 hours in the car arghh but i think it was worth it cause when we were in the gap i was like i like those jeans and jender was like i like that mannequins ass i about lost it
well i think thats it
so im thinking this just means passing thought not definite of getting a nose job
i would like to fix that
well that and i hate my nose like hugetime
i surfed for a bit to see how much itd set me back and they only run like 3 grand
i just dont know how to explain the time off or the different nose to people at work
am i incredibly vain well of course
what do you think i mean i dont really think itd be a waste of money say im gonna live for like at least 40 more years thats just pennies a day
21 its totally fiscally responsible
pull up a chair and mainline the ginko its time for last nights dream im at home with my sis and her husband about to watch a movie so we dim the lights
all of a sudden the wind seems to pick up and a tree flys by the window
im like look that tree has many trunks
and then the wind began to switch the house to pitch and suddenly the hinges started to unhitch just then the witch to satisfy an itch went flying on her broomstick thumbing for a hitch
so we high tailed it outta there and headed for the beach which as we all know is the only safe place during times of hurricane
i dimly recall how i saw in a movie that if theres a hurricane and youre on the beach head south since hurricanes travel north
but since we were on the west coast it was reversed
to get a better view of the situation my mother um hi mom when did you get here suggested that we ride the ferris wheel
from that vantage point we could see what remained of our house and the fact that the winds had died down
so we two step it back to the neighborhood hoping theres something left
on the way we run into my sisters friend she and her husband were okay but it seemed that the cane had swallowed up their dog josh which is sad cause i love josh hes like the only dog ive really liked
i told jender that i liked dogs with people names and shes like what like margerie and im like i said dogs not bridge partners
so im totally bumbed out by this josh is gone thing so i go out with some high school friends
we runningman up to the top of a really tall building
im like hey my house got blown up by that cane
i was pissed that they didnt care more
then my friend steph is like look at this ad i saw in the catholic journal
and its a guy with his hand on a balcony pulling himself up
its like a antisuicide ad and the caption said when youre holdin your golden
it was like even when youve jumped its not too late to grab onto anything
it went on to say that its okay all you need is a good grasp because then the hair products you use will get cought by the wind and carry the majority of your weight to saftey
unfortunately our hair product booted us over the edge
as we fell we grabbed onto the 1st floor balcony and were saved
i was still upset from the apathy of my friends so i was like im going for ice cream
i get the the ice cream counter and the cute attendant slips my a dark chocolate scoop for free
then this girl amber sits next to me and i proceed to hit on her and successfully pick her up which is funny cause i dont like chocolate ice cream
she didnt get what she wanted either so she complained
wackyness ensued and we get chased outta there by this biutch woman
we end up switching ice creams it was sickenly sweet a spectacle
we go to see a movie and back to her place for some drinks meanwhile im like what time is it
shes like 6 why im like i was supposed to catch some gay porn on vh1 at 11 but i guess i missed it
after a few drinks she start kickin it into high gear and im feeling all experimental and im like as long as my pants stay on im not straight
i dont get the reasoning either so i was all about pleasing her and did some things i will not go into not because theyre graphic but because i dont want to remember that
regaurdless i was all about pleasing her which is weird cause im selfish in bed hehe
the next day i go to work as a waiter in this upscale bar
as im waiting the tables i see amber and she calls me over to where her friends are
it turns out that shes kinda a professional woman
not like a ho but rather a girl who hangs out with hot guys who have money so they dont have to buy anything
she turns to her friend shoe another golddigger what the hell kinda name is that and is like this guy knows how to treat a woman shoe hes that good
so amber goes to town on shoe while shoe is licking my eyelid which i dont know if it feels this good in real life lick my eyelid is not really in my pillowtalk repertoire but i was likin it big time
i bolted up from unconsciousness with pink eye and thinking am i a lesbian
i spent so much money yesterday and more to come this weekend
i bought a new down comforter pillow and mattress
i cant wait to hook it all up with my 440 ct sheets im never gonna wanna get outta bed
woohoo im gonna get the mattress delived on tuesday
hopefull by then ill already have the bed frame and desk i want
do you ever listen to music and it brings you back to a time forgotten recently xtcs dear god has been taking me back to last spring
i guess its in part due to the fact that its fucking hot out in the district
but it just reminds me of when i was moving out of pittsburgh and i was cooking everything in my freezer
id make like 5 meals a day
i think one day i made burgers perogies two kinds of rice two kinds of pasta and pork chops
i was like pouring olive oil on everything
i guess thats the guinea in me is that how you spell that or is that like a country im not sure where do you even look up the spelling of racial epithets
used as a disparaging term for a person of italian birth or descent
guess what i saw on the way to work today a perk of living in the nations capital now dont quote me on this cause i have other theories too but i saw what i think was a harrier jet
i was driving along and im like that jet is moving really slow
a little later i notice that it prety much wasnt moving at all
i mean i could be wrong cause i was in traffic and delusional
it was either that or a jet shaped baloon or maybe a jet on a stick
but then again it was green wheras in true lies it was grey
do you think the harrier jet comes in more than one color id like to get one in sky blue cause id be virtually invisible to people on the ground
so i checked the mtv fantasy thing and unfortunately e kicked my ass something like 268 to 170 bitch just kidding i wont know the break down until tonight i could only check out the total score
bigfatstupidloser your mother wants you home by 9
other than that i have nothing to say today
im having a blah blah day
but tonight is new buffy so happy trav
i love you all but dya know what i love more no not anonymous sex
i think someone got here by searching for thalky on google i hope they werent looking for my bro or sis
i shouldve picked something less confusing
but in college people would call me alky thalky cause id drink like a horse and it just kinda stuck well in my head at least nobody really calls me that anymore
so my new or revisited obsession right now is the real world
and with mtv doing the fantasy challenge for the battle of the seasons im giddy and more than a bit pathetic
i encourage all of you to sign up and make a team then let me know what your name is so we can compete ya know
i already made e do it
but today is the last day
go here if you wanna have fun too
or just waste some time
i think i want to apply again want to again not apply again
ive always just put it off
but i think itd be fun
im such a waste of space sometimes
maybe i should just get lost in jersey again
whatever happy monday and good luck with your teams i know none of you will actually do it and i say fuck you
ill be having fun and what will you be doing huh yeah thats right nothing
ps 4 days until moving well maybe 5 but 4 sounds better
i think im gonna check out today at 3 cause its happy weekend and the earlier i leave the less traffic i hit
im in a good mood but i just got to work so i wonder how long that will last
my sister was so moody and funny last night
we were sitting and she was whining about chocolate so she wanted me to get her a cookie dough slim fast bar okay is the concept lost on me or are those things supposed to be for lunch not a post dinner snack so i kept going to the kitchen and firing back the wrong ones
apparently we have like 4 types of bars in the house
but she couldnt catch maybe its genetic oh wait my brother can catch and shes a girl and im a fag so it hit her in the eye
for the rest of the night shes like am i swollen so i got her mind off it by saying no but one of your eyebrows is like an inch lower than the other
i know its not the nicest thing to say but she was annoying
then a game of cards solved it all
i got really angry at my hair last night cause its kinda long
that bitch didnt cut it short enough
seriously i was like an inch from being sent to that island see last entry
so i whipped out the scissors and started cutting
dont get me wrong i wasnt like sculpting i mean im no edward scissorhands
i just thinned out the burns and cut a little off the back so it wouldnt curl under it usually buys me a week and a half
but now i have a bald line through my right sideburn
but if anyone brings it up i have the perfect homo cover person what happened to your hair
see i was trying to save some money for this new kenneth cole jacket so i went to supercuts
i will never do that again
there gonna hear from my lawyer in 2 to 4 days
from now on only dominique touches my hair
shes a miracal worker with my roots
im sorry i have to jam
im off to saks to pick up a new hat to cover this mop
whatta ya think do you buy it
boo did i scare ya im cold right now
i always get cold after lunch
i guess its cause its the only time during the day i drink cold beverage
god that was neither informative nor entertaining
so i was looking through ew this week and i came across an ad for 40 days and 40 nights and i have to admit im intrigued
i mean the movie is gonna suck big time but ill probably see it
i mean josh hartnett forgoing all forms of sex for lent
it must be fraught with sexual tension and inuendo
i on the other hand have never nor will i ever give up anything for lent
how is that proving yourself to god or some such shit
i would always mock give up stuff like homework or taxes or better yet women
did i tell you guys
wait ill do a little search
i work with a tom jones
i think thats so funny
i told someone this the other day and they started to laugh so im like its not unusual
in addition to that i work with a brian wilson and its fun fun fun just like lying in bed
to top it all off i think i heard a page once for a dennis hopper but im looking into that
sorry for the pittiful puns
i forgot my phone again today
fuck but regaurdless i think im moving next weekend
i just gotta give the complex a call and make sure i can get a parking space
you cant see me but im doing the running man right now
god i wore out so many shoes and stubbed so many toes in the early 90s with that
what in gods name were we thinking
i mean dancing is supposed to be sexy to an extent or at least beautiful
when was the last time you said wow look at that guy he can run in place for hours while making earpiercing noises with his chuck taylors
that is hot or the cabbagepatch i used to have a friend that was all about the cabbagepatch
i would never dance with her cause she was uncoordinated and i got bruised
so we made up our own hothot dance moves like pickingupthechange climbingthewall lockingthedoor and other daily activities seemingly mundane but foxy when the envelope was pushed
who am i kidding it was just to make eachother laugh
getting sexy outta those dances was like getting water from a rock
well im gonna go back to my silent desk and dream about furniture
okay yeah i know i already updated this once this afternoon but i have something to say now
i dont know about the rest of you but when i go out for a smoke i want a peaceful time to be with my thoughts i dont want to make small talk with airfilterreplacingmulletman
i mean what am i supposed to say when are you gonna wake up and smell the mulletssuck
i mean to some extent theyre beautiful like all nature
but like other critters they are to be observed occasionally for entertainment in their natural habitat such as monster truck shows wrestling matches and country bars not thrust into our world causing confusion and upheaval
i was almost tempted to say honey we dont talk to the help
what is a person to do when confronted with raw nature in an otherwise baked environment do we a nod and respond with shortnoncommital phrases or b whip out the sheers and conduct displacement experiments i chose a but b was eating away at me
maybe to ensure the safety of everyone especially the children we should put them all on an island
well at least i was out there long enough to see cute firemen in uniforms
im not sure if this is a valid feeling
yesterday they came around with a card for a gift for one of my coworkers who had a baby
originally it was because i was here for a very short time
actually i saw the first one of them on my second day
and since then there have been like 3 or so babies and 2 or so weddings
im not made of money
i know its not a lot to give
i cant figure out if thats the reason or its just me being jealous of things that i will never have
i could be that someone came by with a happy birthday sign and some candy for me yesterday
there is another travis who started like last week i guess it was his
i didnt know they did such things here since in my third month of working here my birthday came and left with no peanutbutter cups
can you still see me oh wait
sorry im in a funk i think its cause im trying to get a heads up on the crest white strips cause im not gonna be home friday so i doubled up
and man do my teeth hurt right now
i had a very interesting weekend
i think the highlight of it was playing egyptian rat screw with my sister
but shes so wacky sometimes
she was really getting into it
after ever game shed be like im getting all swetty
she was a slapping fiend
but i did get to watch newsies and i almost cried i would have if i didnt think traci would get on me for it
i just love that movie
maybe its all the cute boys okay a good portion of them are of legal age the others well thats just sick singing and dancing and fighting
also i got quite a lot of qaf in
im finally to episodes ive never seen
ive come to the realization that its not as bad as i had originally thought
strangely enough the lesbians are the best actors in the bunch and are a large part of why i continue to watch
okay all the naked men contribute
but i have a huge problem with the whole this is pittsburgh thing
i mean i lived there for four years and its not that cool
and they talk about the susquehanna okay dude there are three rivers in pittsburgh and that is not one of them
its like 100 miles away in harrisburg
they also bring up my car the audi tt is a fuck machine the guys who drive it usually arent
they just havent met me

i dont know if its cause its such a nice day but who the hells knows
i kinda wish i had a digital video camera cause the birds were around again and i wanna show yins cause its really cool
oh they were talking about heinz field today on the radio and how some of the players from some other team were told to mark their territory
so they peed on the field
i only wish that i had peed on it when i broke in cause then id call the station and be like well i already marked it
well thats about it right now
i have to fight the urge to do a cartwheel down the halls of the office
does this happen to anyone else i just cant help grinning today
im thinking of making up a faux excuse to go home
heres how the conversation would go t i have to go i have an appointment mr
boss man bing with whom t um
bmb why are you seeing a chronologist t he puts my life in order rim shot then the harp i stole from scrooge mcduck start singing you are fibbing fibbing fiiiiiibbiiiiing
and flintheart glomgold swipes my stud finder as the beagle boys make off with my car and magica despell turns me straight ewww
and launchpad and doofus continually trip in the corner while webby plays dressup with bubba
what was i talking about again life is like a hurricane here in duckburgh racecars lasers airplains its a duckblurr might solve a mystery or rewrite history
im getting so sick of creed
i mean its not like i dont like the music but cmon
my sacrifice is no second comming of christ
actually right now i think due to my long commute im sick of quite a lot of bands heres a short list creed lenny kravitz red hot chili peppers janes addiction smashing pumpkins dave matthews band this is not to say that i dont like any of this music its just lay off the repeat
and what is with duncan sheik since when is barely breathing in heavy rotation i think i was on the eastbumblefuck station
i mean you just have to save a little of your fame for later use
i mean we all know what happens when you overplay
any one of these could be you hootie cranberries spin doctors hanson ewwww tlc forgive me if i put any onehitwonders in there i was going for one big album one ok album than jack
i dont know what this rant was about but whatever
i cant wait to get dsl cause amazon alone has all these downloadable songs
especially the boxer i have no speakers at work so i cant
but if you do give it a listen
or at least the sample
im like a zombie right now and ive been sitting in a strange position for the past 2 hours so my butts kinda asleep
this morning i loaded my phone up with travis song so thats what ive been listening to
but im feeling kinda losery cause i keep getting baby one more time in my head travis made a version of this thats actually pretty good
well less than an hour till i get to go home
ill leave you with a song kookaburra sits on an old gum tree merry merry king of the bush is he laugh kookaburra laugh kookaburra gay your life must be all together now kookaburra sits on an old gum tree eating all the gumdrops he can see stop kookaburra stop kookaburra save some gums for me one more time kookaburra sits on an old gum tree counting all the monkeys he can see stop kookaburra stop kookaburra thats no monkey thats me i dont know about you but that woke me up
hey did anyone see the amas i didnt but everyone i mean radio is talking about carbon leaf and ive heard one song on the radio
its big into the irish thing which i know is a little passe but its pretty darntootin good
but theyre not really signed so you can only get there cd in richmond which im not treking out there for a cd
ill just scour the web when i get dsl
so as the days progress im approaching definite on this apartment
the deal is just pretty hard to pass up
i was in best buy yesterday theres a fuckin surprise and i got a little nervous due to my purchases
i dont think im completely comfortable wearing my sexuality on my sleve and that kinda bothers me
i mean the way i dress its a definite but
i just made the gayest purchase
i bought buffy season 1 newsies queer as folk season 1 and moulin rouge
i mean i might as well been wearing capris pants and a midrif
am i a bad fag or is my trepidation warranted but now its work again
i dont want to be here
well off to waste my youth and beauty at a computer
my last entry got me thinking would you rather be smart like us only my friends read this and im not friends with stupid people
well i dont want to get anyone mad at me and pretty like us only my friends read this and im not friends with ugly people
well i dont want to get anyone mad at me
be dumb like melissa rivers and gorgeous like mike greybeal or jessica alba for the ladies
actually she a great example cause shes shitrocks dumb thats the big question and i dont have an answer
i would instinctively say id like to be like me but i would like to test out being ultra pretty
can you imagine the ass youd be able to get and maybe those stunads dont realize what its like to have thoughts about the future the world politics global warming mandatory waiting periods for firearms acquisition etc
as thomas gray says to each his suffrings all are men condemnd alike to groan the tender for anothers pain th unfeeling for his own
yet ah why should they know their fate since sorrow never comes too late and happiness too swiftly flies thought would destroy their paradise
no more where ignorance is bliss t is folly to be wise
and as jessica alba says huh speaking of dumb my sister asked me for a review of fractions
i started laughing at her this comming from the girl who got one of the 2 as in criminal procedure i mean incredibly intelligent but she wants a multdiv fraction lesson
i told her to just use a calculator and shes like i was going to until my friends were talking about the final saying how they couldnt believe how some stupid people brought calculators to the exam
she was sheepish it was cute
go me im 3 lbs from my target weight
i just checked this morning but i dont know how reliable one weighing instance is
cause sometimes you havnt eaten in a while or you drank a lot of water or you took a really big shit what have you
so i hope its for real
my morning and evening routines have gotten longer
im back on the crest white strips
i think my teeth are currently at an acceptable level of whiteness
they were pretty bad before i did them in november now i have a week and a half left
so that twice a day
then i have like 6 new facial products to use whereas before i had 1 if that
also i shave like daily now cause i dont want to put all crazy skin shit on my hairy faccia
all in all i think its working out but my eyes are getting more easily tired
and thanks to jender and swank for recommending bumble and bumble
i like the styling creme
what a fag and with my target weight almost accomplished i think that i may be ready to start working out
i have an easier time losing fat than transforming fat to muscle i can start with a blank slate wait its clean slate blank canvas
im such a dumbass i just want to be pretty
i was up last night watching the sopranos with my sis
that show is the bees knees
im so psyched to have hbo if i move into that place
and mtv considering the new season of real world starts tomorrow
i had a hitchcockian moment earlier today
i go outside for a nicbreak right and there are like 200 birds perched on the other building
then they swoop down into the trees that line the sidewalk in like a steady stream
i just wish they were louder like crows not like chirpchirp and it was night
i love having birds moments
its so spookey and fun
but they were gone the next time i went out
i forgot my phone again today
so i checked out that place and im gonna give it a favorable review
not because its so rad but because id have money to have fun with
itd save me like 5 cnotes a month
and we all know how i like to spend
speaking of which im all about this line of crate and barrel shit
im looking for some pics to link to
desk and bed do ya like it theres also these shelves and my sis showed me this crap she got at target like desk accessories etc
well im off to think about moving
i just noticed the 5 shelf shelves redundancy are no longer available i should go back to the store and snatch a coupla those bad boys up
this would also separate some of my furniture into different months credit card bills
and stave off my compulsive instant gratification desire
tonight i go look at that place i was talking about yesterday
i have nothing much to say today
ive been a little nervous cause i want this to work out
i hope hes normal and not ugly but not too attractive
is it weird to have stipulations about how the person you live with looks well i guess not so much weird but shallow i dont know its been like 3 years since ive lived with someone i didnt know
i just hope the age difference doesnt show too much cause i still want to be able to watch cartoons and play video games
look at me running off at the mouth when its not even definite
whatever i need a cigarette
to begin today a little update
oralskank still hasnt gotten back to me but i did get a response from someone else
now tell me what you think
625 excellent all utils including dsl and cable right on parking etc
sounds too good well it may be
hes 32 and his screen name involves the numbers 69
im a little concerned about this
maybe hes just juvenile enough to think that that number is funny or something but didnt we grow out of that in like 6th grade well i mailed him back and asked some questions
and on the map it looks really easy to get to from the east
okay on to a new subject
my sister brought this up last night
on jeopardy they just say in the form of a question and they dont really expound on that so she was like if i got on jeopardy instead of saying what is jupiter id say is it jupiter this went back an forth until we got a little out of hand heres some possibilities for jeopardy answers old way what is
an american bulldog where is
elizabeth taylor what is on top of old smokey what is
pizza new way did i just run over
an american bulldog do they have whorehouses in
milan does anybody really care about
elizabeth taylor have you ever had sex
on top of old smokey do you throw up from eating too much
pizza see the improvement i do
also i went to wendys for lunch in memoriam
when i got in there travis was playing on the sound system
i was like even from heaven dave thomas you have wonderful taste
but then the guy charged me 50 cents for some bbq sause
snotnosedolderthanmeyetworkingatwendys ass looking back on today i think i would do things differently to be funny
dya ever do that its kinda annoying cause youre like damnnit i coulda been funny but instead i was a sniveling mule
this morning when the police officer was waving me over he was on foot i should have just looked at him stupidly and waved
pretending he was just being cordial
now that wouldve been funny
and at wendys today when that guy charged me for some topping that probably cost 30 pesetas i shoulda been like dude show some respect
now you gotta ask yourself what would wendys founder dave thomas do ooh thats a good bumper sticker wwwfdtd
maybe not it either sounds like a web site for flower delivery or something youd find on sunday smackdown
well at least im feeling a little more up
maybe thats because ive decided not to stay late today maybe not who the fuck am i kidding of course thats why
today sucks and its only 9 i cant wait to see what happens later
1 i forgot my phone so the only way i have music to listen to is if i go outside to get my cds out of my car
2 i got a ticket this morning 44 in a 25 school zone
fuck that i swear i was going 35 i was still in 3rd gear
im going to do some internet research into the efficacy of laser in adverse conditions
3 i havent heard back from the dentist bitch im sure shes perfectly nice
4 i may or may not be allergic to some of the skin care products ive been using i cant stop sneezing
5 i cant think of number 5
6 im going to jenders tonight and without a phone have no way of letting her know what to order from red pepper if youre reading this just pick something that we wrote good next to 7 dave thomas wendys founder and friend to all grease lovers died
so have a fucking good day i know i wont
hey i think i may have come up with some sort of general idea for a script but i have to flush it out in order to see if it would make a good flick
hey it keeps my hands occupied otherwise thered be a party in my pants every hour on the hour
i am a marketers wet dream
i saw this little piece in entertainment weekly my bible about a line of skin care products for men
so i decided to get some
ive never really used any and im entering my selfbetterment phase of the year so i bust out the plastic and head for the mall
the only place i could find them was saks and i must say i was not really pleased with their service
i guess the 2 foot shelf for mens skin care is not really a money maker but honestly
i was browsing the shelf for zihr for like 20 minutes and not a single querry about how my search was going
i go to check out and the woman was helping someone else while taking my credit card so i didnt get to ask any questions
meanwhile i was borderline going to buy the shaving gel if i couldve gotten a price from her but nothing so i said no
so i get home after dropping a sizable load of cash and that night i wanted to use the stuff so i had to shave first weekends are usually razor free for my lazy ass
my sister flipped out when she heard the water running so long shes like youre shaving at midnight so i started using
i bought the undereye cream im such a mo cause i have a genetic predisposition for black bags and i dont mean prada
so i think i have to call one of my lady friends to see how to use this stuff
i got bottles galore each with its 10wordsorless instructions so im kinda confused
and also im curious about how long before it kicks in
i mean if you start using moisturizer is you face instantly gonna stop producing oil or do you have a coupla days with too much i hope i continue to use cause if not theres a benjamin down the toilet
also i may have found a suitable place to live
i gotta see if this 26 yr old dentist chick responds to my email
i was all swervy on the road this morning but now im all in the zone at work
im designing my ass off
well not really just improving on some things i halfassed earlier
so last night i went to borders to get an oragami oneaday calendar but they were out so i bought a screenwriting book instead
its interesting i didnt realize how structured the process is
now all i need is to come up with an idea
i hope it comes to me soon
but until then i should read the whole book before i foray into that process
the woman at the store was like oh are you a screenwriter and im like no i just needed a hobby for this month
i fly through things so quickly
id be surprised if im still interested in this come the buffy season 1 dvd release jan 15th mark your calendars
but i like to dabble in lots of hobbies cause this way i get to learn a little about a lot of industries
it makes a well rounded person or at least a good trivial pursuit player
i dont really feel like writing today
i just dont feel funny and i hate mediocre entries
oh last night i had an awesome dream
dya ever have one of those love dreams
like full on chickflick love
complete with sidestories annoying secondary characters and melodrama the gays love their melodrama
i didnt want to wake up
much more satisfying than a sex dream i mean i can much more efficiently handle that in the waking hours
heres to thinking about my dream man
back at work after a kicking new year in manhattan
i had so much fun
we went out like every night hang bummed all day
but not much of it is funny beside the new years party itself
well first off do you know that theres this channel in nyc that plays ads for porn its great but they wouldnt let me watch it
girls can be such prudes
oh and friday night i run into an old friend from college at a bar in union square i hadnt seen her in like 2 years
ny is a lovely yet strange place
anywho so we went out to the china club at arount 830 or so
it opened at 10 and there was no line so we went to a bar across the street for a round
meanwhile i had half a dozen beers at netsies place get back in line about a half hour before the doors open and its freezing
there was a girl in front of us smoking and i thought she looked cold so i offered to give her one of my gloves
so we all started talking and her other friends showed up
one was from birmingham and im like in my head alabama but then he started talking and he was obviously from england
so he asked us where we were from and im like originally connecticut
well it turns out hes staying with people from fairfield right near my home trumbull
so glove girl was like do you know ellen tollman and im like yeah i touched her breast in 6th grade
i was off the hook
so we get in and have a lot of fun drinking and dancing
all of a sudden i notice that theres nobody on the stage so i jump on and start dancing draging a friend with me
so a little while after that im up on a block on the stage and i lose my balance
i was craking up so hard then a friend of mine wanted to go so i made sure she knew how to get home and let her go
okay not my most chivalrous act but it was like 1230 and i wanted to partay about an hour or so later another one bites the dust and boots on the floor and a little on my new shoes i might add
so netsie packed her up and headed for the coast
so we were down to 3
3 am rolls around and i cant find any of the remainder of our crew
finally we hook up and take off
by this time times square which we had to majorly bypass to get to the club was now kinda empty making it a straight shot across 47th
we make a quick stop at mcdonalds
i order a double cheeseburger meal
when it shows up i get all pissed and am like theres only one i have two patties and one bun what the hell am i supposed to do well it turns out i really wanted the two cheeseburger meal so i could share but i was too gone to think straight
i have the same problem with twin and double beds i can never remember which is which so the next day i get up at 920 and have to walk 12 blocks to meet my sister at my brothers place
but with some new bruises a strained shoulder and a kicking new limp
i had a weird dream last night about acid rain and the looney toons
sylvesters umbrella dissolved and his hair fell out
but thats all i can remember maybe i saw it on tv maybe it wasnt a dream at all hrmmm
its the little things in life that make you happy
if i get into work and theres already coffee made i start beaming
but i always have to feel the pot cause sometimes its just yesterdays afternoon coffee
that stuff is just raunch still no word from femmedds
im starting to lose confidence
youve done nothing but study swordplay eeh
more a pursue than a study
have you ever considered piracy youd make a wonderful dread pirate roberts
sorry got a little princess bride on the brain
im gonna pay my ticket over the phone i dont think va transfers points
how funny would it be if i had to find a job in the city and couldnt drive my car cause i got dropped from insurance
well not really funny considering its hard to find engineering jobs in cities
and then my beautiful baby would become like a hemmorrhaging abscess on my bank account
com just got like 3 hits for that one but allinall things are looking up and settling down after the money suck that was the holiday season
friday i look forward to tonsofun at swanks swanky new pad
oh did anyone catch the real world chicago thingy that was on last night
well it sucked but i have a new love
chris the gay guy from mass
but a recovering alcoholic so that wouldnt really work out
but i look forward to some hot manonman action this year
hopefully its not lame like last year
its kinda sad that i still watch this
im 22 youd think id have my own life
now i have to feed vicariously off 7 losas
well maybe this year 6 losas and a hottie
so as the day rises anew i contemplate the efficacy of my rapport with the human species
have i lost all propencity for serious thought i find myself have trouble going 10 minutes without crackin wise
oh my god who was that it wasnt me
well tonight i get to go out
woohoo i put myself on a 100 stipend this week cause i was running low on cash realistically i didnt think i could do it
but tomorrows pay day and i have 89 buck in the wallet
i know all of you are probably like thank god
that dudes been dull since he hasnt been hungover
and believe me im with you
im only really funny when im in incredible discomfort
but im still gonna take it easy tonight
cause im still gonna watch a little mustseeteevee
well feel free to type a little suin suin in the tagboard it makes me feel loved
well i finallly got arount o doing something with this site
i think its looking better but theres always room for improvement but im busy right now so i cant write any more
later lovers yeah you wish
so i kicked netflix into high gear
but today has been boring ive been staying in all week and im ready to go out but im gonna wait at least until thursday
im not really feeling particularly funny today or interesting or even awake so im gonna keep this really short
well ill catch you guys on the flip side
heres hoping for omelettes tomorrow
a few things today i was listening to the radio this morning and some people are nuts
on whfs who i think is trying to get a little edgier they were at the grammys talking to porn stars and there was either taking pictures of unclothed women or oral sex i was switching during the commercial
and in the spirit of grand theft auto elliot was talking about a game he wants to get backing for where youre terrorists who take over the olympics which i think is a little too out there
reguardless of wether or not its fun i just think its too reckless
however i came up with a game that has edge and also is less politically offensive
its called homeless or maybe grifters but the latter is a little more restrictive
id like it to be a rags to riches adventure where it begins with some simple panhandlingpickpocketingmugging then progressess to griftingprostitutionrobbery and from there to cockfightsdrugtraffickingpimping and finally to wetworksheistingkidnapping
and along the way your personal concerns will change as well
in the beginning your only goal will be securing hootch and rinsing out your only pair of socks but by the end it will be setting up an offsure bank account in grand cayman and buying a mansion in a nonextradition country
well heres another dream it didnt come last night cause i woke up every 10 minutes for some reason but rather yesterday napping in the noontime sun
check out white stripes fell in love with a girl
thats good punk so i had this dream where i went to my distant cousins house for a funeral
i was walking around talking to people and noticing that there was a lot of inappropriate touching between men for calling hours is that even what its called
so im on my cell with e cause thats like all i do lately
i drop the phone and go to pick it up but i cant hear anything anymore
then i hear a little hellohello comming from my water glass
i just kept running up to people laughing and saying hey my friends stuck in this glass
say something to this woman erica
then i realize that both the microphone and the speaker of my phone are rolling around in the glass
i shut up cause i feel stupid now
meanwhile back in the funeral of inappropriate fondling clothes are kinda comming off and im perplexed
i turn to my friend and am like im getting the feeling that this is not so much my cousins house as it is a gay brothel
i guess i got the address wrong
i think i either have a food alergy or a gum inflamation
im not happy with it
i have seen the face of god and damn that boy is fine
no really i went out last night and i have about 30 nightime donts for you
so after i stupidly forgot to get tickets for the hypnotist and jender went home i went out a bar yeah news to whom
i want to appologize to everyone i called last night
especially e who got a call at like 3 or as i like to call it 90 minutes into my walk home hang on im getting there
so im out at a bar thats playing the gayest moments in movies or some such shit
like the funeral from steel magnolias the first performance from sister act etc
i see the hottest person in the world my fucking luck he was a bartender mike
its not important so i go talk to him
long story short i make friends with 3 really hot guys him his boyfriend and a friend from nyc
at least i got to see two really hot guys kiss
so they invite me to a club it was fun but im not sure how frequently i can take that
this was like the hottest selection of guys ive seen in my life but shallow like a fox
i need to work out cause just losing weight makes my skinny but not hot
these guys were all shirtless and gorgeous and meanwhile im like ive had 5 hours of sleep since thursday gimme a break
so i pretty much fell asleep 4 times on the dancefloor
okay i think were ready for the donts this story got boring
i think the best part of going out is checking your pockets the next day
its a veritable whos who of crap
dont go out to a club with ppl
youve known for like 30 minutes even if theyre hot cause they dont have your back
okay like 2 hours is okay 2
dont call your friend for confirmation of your prettyness on saturday cause they aint home and they just get really worried and call you later when you have no idea who they are and when sequins came back into style
dont call them at 9 the next morning either cause theyre just mad
dont go to a club on no sleep cause you aint looking pretty
just because you see the washington monument does not mean you can walk home
when thinking about walking home call a cab its easy to romanticize but 2 hours later when you have the beer shits from the previous night its not fun
when your on an exodus walking home and you come across train tracks find another way dont hop the fence and narrowly dodge an approching train
dont balancebeam on a railing 30 feet above traffic while tangoing with an oak
dont go out when youre still hungover cause the beer shits catch up to you while youre walkin past the smithsonian
live it learn it love it
note preceding event have been exaggerated for humorous effect i was really not in danger even e thinks so
yeah im messed up i just spent the last hour and a half staring at a chicklet so much has happened since last we talked
well i sent out my tax stuff to my dad okay lame start but im saving the good stuff for later and instead of a return address i put jo babbydaddy he knows where it made me laugh im gonna have to explain ebonics to him though
so i went out last night
i think theres a conspiracy against gays in that people are trying to keep us drunk
cause when i was straight i never went to bars that had whole nights where beer was free
i mean how spiteful can you be
so i was there with spark and i went to buy the next round
i find out when i get back that goodyear asked him if we were up for a threesome
but to me hes like i wanted to pull out a little karen and be like tubby i dont think so
me i was like i wanted to pull out a little karen and be like aww honey why dont you head over to bobs big boy and pick up a leg a wing and a biscuit
theres a threesome thats more your speed
hahaha im even funny with the rabble
spark was cracking up and was like oh yours was much better
so later that evening yeah i missed mk skate but im glad i would have cried i hit on some boys
most of which had boyfriends
but this one i was givin the hungry eye to was cross room flirting
nothing became of it so a few hours later i approached and was like im doing some market research
why didnt you respond to the eye im totally not kidding
im such an ass i was travisrashed
but i gathered some good info on his demo and got a few nice compliments
compliments dont play the piper
so i get home at like 456
honey i dont remember i was too tired
and i wake up at like 10
all last night i was professing how i was gonna call in sick but i didnt here i am at work
so i drive in and im all about getting mcds breakfast hungover happy
so i pass two dons in the disctrict and make my way to annap
i get to the one here at 1045 and im like are you still serving breakfast
the guy laughed at me and was like no we stop serving at 1030
i wanted to be like dude you dont have to laugh its 10freakin45 its not like its 3
so i go to pull out and low and behold little ms
hunchback with a dog backs into my sgt
i need to get work done now id be rippin mad if i wasnt so funny
so i had this excuse all prepared
cause everyone else at work uses their kids to get outta stuff yeah like i buy that timmy needed to go to the doctor
so im all ready to be like sorry janey had a dentist appointment and the little one got an earache but what are you gonna do at that age you just cant get mad at them
even though you just wanna hit them and take away their walking privledges
but i didnt have to use it since i got into that accident
my favorite thing to say now when people bring up current events that im not familiar with is to say oh im sorry i dont watch straight porn
that and i started answering the phone by saying go ahead caller youre on the air
also and this is the best one
i slipped up and said that is so sugar
instead of sweet i think ill keep that one
im so bored that im playing a rubber band rendition of mr
sandman bring me a dream bumbumbumbum make him the cutest boy ive ever seen bumbumbumbum what time does michelle skate tonight cause i may wanna go out
go kwan go kwan get funky
i was talking to tim and im like wouldnt it be funny if my deal was that i shot people with rubber bands but right before i struck a pose theyd call me the rubber bandit and my sidekick would be paper clipto
we would rob from places like staples and office max
so something in the hall is making noise like a wind up toy
im so tempted to run around the office saying is somebody playing scategories i want in i think if i win powerball tonight im gonna rent a little old lady to come in to work with me tomorrow and set up and omelette station
i could go up to everybody and be like hey have you guys eaten cause edna here makes a killer omelette
get back in there bitch youre on the clock and weve got some takers nothin says share the happy like an omelette made to order
i know i just posted an entry but i needed to get this off my chest before i forgot
my officemate is just on today hes been making me laugh all morning
when i told him about my daily grind idea which after a discussion with jender last night has incorporated personalized catalog shopping sound cool send money and ill get it on its feet and hes like ooh like the peach pit and the peach pit after dark
but better yet is what just happened
see lately ive been havin a hankerin for a mcds breakfast a bec scuit to be exact and i was talking about how they should delive
then i went on to tell him how someone i was talking to live in a place where they had mcpizza and they dilivered
so this is how it went down
keep in mind i was trying to say test market
look at me its like im setting up for a blooper
im dick clark introducing a carol burnette flub me so i was talking to someone and they had mcpizza in their area i think they lived in
whats that called tim um
the czech republic i cracked up
i hope that translated well but im not sure it was one of those timing thing like jenders haa cha cha this weekend
so did you catch michelle kwans performance last night it was pretty good
i was torn cause that was on at the exact same time that the uconn game was winding down fyi they were down by 5 through like the entire 2nd half they just couldnt protect from the 3s and giving up a lot of boards geeze youd almost think i was straight but somehow things turned around when michelle was skating shes done so much for me okay not too straight
i think i odd on parentheticals
i dont know why i like kwan so much maybe its cause i think that shes a good role model a good symbol of america or maybe its because shes really my mother
and a good showing by the other americans going 34
that stupid slutskaya ruined the 123
i dont trust that girl
she once gave me a breath mint and i woke up 4 days later in a onesie in georgia with a south of the border sticker on my ass
im becomming one of those crazys thats what we call my cousins from west virginia
im thinking of going to see a hypnotist this weekend
he was on the radio this morning and it seemed like a lot of fun
id like to participate cause i think that im funny anyway so maybe under the influence id be a laugh riot
people at work probably think im very strange im chair dancing right now to basement jaxx wheres your head at its funny cause its true
last night after watching a very homophobic blossom
i mean real world and a new ep of qaf i was flicking and put on darkwing duck
spark got a weird look on his face and im like thats okay we can put something else on ill just watch it in 10 years when nostalgia is in
hahahahah im cracking up but not because of that that was kinda lame but because of the onesie joke before
so im back on a dream of days past see past
ive been thinking a lot about winning powerball and opening the daily grind
but now its expanded to be a coffee shopbarbowlingpool etc
ooh ooh and maybe it could have like a neon strickthrough and the word nightly so at night the name changes the best part is id sell magazines
yknow how it is when youre like hey lets go get some magazines
and your friend is like wicked idea but where do they sell those look no further
but it wouldnt be very successful cause i dont like stress but i wouldnt mind cause id have my pb winnings
god why cant i have a failing business
id also have trivial pursuit cards all around cause i was at a place where they did and i thought it was cool
what else oh yeah boxed wooden matched only
cant you picture it id call you up and say come on down to the daily grind id say its half price corona and cond nast
gotta go i just choked on my own spit damn im a moron
good morning good morning weve talked the whole night through good morning good morning to you
not to me im beat
i got in late but its presidents day and i for one think that nobody should be working let alone me
my excuse was that since schools are out i had to find an appropriate day care for my kids
like id ever have kids
i dried my sweater way too much
i guess people at work will just think im even stranger
i guess it doesnt help that my jeans have big cuffs at the bottom cause i have to wear them low to accomadate the tattoo
hey when its all better ill put a nice picture up of it
im so pathetic just looking at those zs made me tired
so its sunday night and im trying to decide what position i will play in this new society that i have become a member of
i have to get past my shyness but i fear that i may go too far
i dont want to become the slut or do i its also a valid position but im not sure whats for me
ive realized that im young and hot and pretty much i can decide what i want
is it lots of sex with people i dont know or is it something more i dont know
i had a dream that i came home and there were a dozen boxes of harry and david pears on my doorstep
why am i subconsciously getting fruit delivered maybe its cause my mom hasnt ordered me any omaha steaks in a while
im such a spoiled brat
okay so last year my brother got me these deisel jeans and theyre awsome but i was fat then and theyre about 3 inches too big in the waist
so now i look at myself in the mirror and even though im swimming in these puppies i look fat
but im done losing weight and i cant aford to get another pair
do you think i can call my mom and ask if shell pay for it i mean its for my health
i was listening to the radio this morning and they were talking about fights at supermarkets
this pharmacist said that some guy came in with a forged prescription and he refused to fill it
a few minutes later he was beaned by a can of ensure i had to laugh i can just picture it to your health fucker whooosh boink hehe
happy freakin valentines day to all you
every year i think i should be all depressed on this day but for some reason im not
i mean ive never really had anyone on this day so i guess i dont know what im missing
i guess when it comes down to it im gonna get depressed about not only this day but the other 364 as well
i guess it doesnt help that my hair is looking a little
well lets not get into that
i think i have to go see a doctor about a certain
shit i dont wanna talk about it
its not like its getting bad but ive just talked to a few people who are like nip it in the bud
i mean my bro has had his share of difficulty with it and he always warns me not to mention my trick this weekend said something about early action
yeah like that wasnt embarrassing this is fucking great now im in a spectacular mood
whyd you have to bring this shit up
thanks a lot on another note i think i am done dieting
i looked at myself in the mirror and im like hey youre skinny
and not just straight skinny thats easy but gay skinny
so i can eat what i want now
i think im still gonna stick to diet coke damn freud will not let me type that word cleanly cause i dont wanna rebound
okay im in a better mood
and hey you gotta be happy when you only have one day left of your moneyless week
hey check out phantom planet california its really good
how come cartoon pigs all have stutters porky piglet im sure there have been others
what is it about the pig that we find it is necessary to impede their speach
is it cause they are so cute in drawn form we must even the score so the other barnyard animals dont get jealous it was just a general wonderingment i was having
geeze im ready to go home
if you were to ask me to pick up a brick right now id say fuck no pick it up your own damn self
did i mention i was cranky too
i was listening to the raadio today and they were talking about this event theyre having comming up called kegs and eggs
its a party from 8amnoon
it sounds like a lot of fun but its on a friday
it seems kinda messed up to take a whole day off just for a four hour party
and it seems like the think that you may stumble home from not walk
but carbon leaf is playing
ill think about it its a month from friday 2 days prior to jenders birthday
on another note i just ran out of money i mean until friday
i kinda flipped out yesterday about it
then i realized i have another check before next rent
its just with these alimony payments now i have to rebudget
yeah i know thats a lie but i thought it was better than i spent 300 on a blanket and a pillow
sometimes i just have to give myself a knowing look and say wheres your head at
so ive been watching the olympics a lot
but last night was heartbreaking
what happened during the pairs freeskate long program
it was canada hands down
the the canadians were like this is horseshit
you call this a sport
we skated our asses off
oh wait that was db sweeny
then i caught the end of the us mens curling match against canada
we conceeded at 93 in the 9th
but i guess i couldnt be too upset with the mens halfpipe sweep by americans
singlehandedly put us back in the medal run lead with germany
i almost cried when i saw all three american flags going up
kinda like that commercial with the guy who takes a picture of himself sleeping and writes wish i was here xx on it
so im thinking of getting another tatoo
well ive wanted one for a while but heres my reasoning
i want to get it on my tummy
for one i think its sexy but also i think it may deter me from getting fat cause i wouldnt want to stretch it
it would also detract from my less than washboard abs or maybe itd accent them who knows
so what do you think im not sure if theyd let me since my navel is pierced maybe its like a cart before the horse sorta thing
but i dont know what id get
the first one i had planned for a while so i knew what i wanted but this one im not sure
if you have any suggestions guestbook me
i know i dont want any living things like dragons or lizards i dont do that tounge thing
i think i like designs
well if i get bored today ill doodle
im officially the stupidest person in america
i was doing laundry today while talking to e
i get back to my place and realize that i locked myself out
okay lets set the stage
i did a little drinking last night and got a little lucky too so today i have those pesky beer shits
so im locked outta my apartment with no shoes and none of the maintnance people are home
but what i could do was finish my laundry read silver lining
wait i cant finish this right now i need to shower i still have sex on me
okay clean as a whistle
and one of my neighbors was singing really loudly
i took that time i was given the gift of time to catch up on my correspondence there wer too many friends quotes in there
so then singersongwriter with a clay mask came out and tried to help me locate someone to let me in
finally i had e scratch up my roomates cell
so i give him a call
an hour later i realize i have my emergency plastic key and i can go get cigarrettes outta my car
i go down into the grage closing the locked door behind me effectivly trapping me in the garage
luckily when i finished the cigarrette my roomate drove in
he was carrying a big box so he threw me the keys and as a good gay man i missed them
they hit my square in the right nut
a perferct end to a perfect day
i am officially borderline alcoholic
i woke up this morning at 7 on my bathroom floor covered in vom and with heavy boxers
ive never shat myself before i guess theres a first time for everything
thats why im telling all yous guys
i have to go shopping for our party soon
see this is the shit that happens when i hang out with my brother
im just glad i wasnt in bed cause i have expensive sheets
i think i danced with annie last night
you know the little orphan
dog by the name of sandy
shes okay but really cheap
she claims shes had a hard knock life and im like take a number sister i just crapped myself
can you feel that aw shit ooohahahahah its friday
and if anyone cant tell i have dsl
its like ive been freed from a 4 year prison of slow transfers and drop offs
i dont even know when i went to bed i was having fun looking for
if you wanna talk to me ill be on im a lot more
ill still be away all day at work but at nights
its the kick i dld like 8 songs before work today including disturbeds down with the sickness which explains the intro
i think my brother is comming to town today
i gotta find out soon what were gonna do cause we have that party tomorrow night
do you know what today is its day one of the 19th winter olympic games
im so psyched but the only thing on today is ski jumping
well everyone enjoy their day i know i will
and heres a little playlist to think of carbon leaf american tale disturbed down with the sickness hoobastank crawling in the dark social distortion ball and chain jimmy eat world in the middle remy zero save me phantom planet california
sometimes im not the brightest bulb on the chandelier
im trying to hook in to preexisting dsl connection and im not to sure about the things im gonna need
i dont know if its me but im not sure if my deoderant is working
i think a certain old spice is gonna have to buy a certain someone a stick of his old stuff
tuesday when i was out i was playing pool
i had a few drinks so i was shooting really poorly
i actually used the phrase well at least im pretty
i think it shows a lot fo personal growth
i hope im getting past my poor selfimage thing
i mean listeng to someones selfmutilating banter is about as fun as listening to two bluejays at a melissa etheridge concert
so i guess im off to drop a few bills this afternoon too
shit but as i always say you gotta spend money to watch porn
someone just googled to me by searching for communism in north america
well im just assuming cause i didnt actually talk to them
ive been thinking lately about people that were once in my life that i lost touch with
she was my best friend from like 2nd grade till 8th grade
i havent talked to her in like 5 years
whenever i run into people from thx i ask them about her but i never seem to run into her
i guess part of me just kinda misses her
i mean this is the girl with whom i organized apple sauce straw races in elementary school
which is how i still eat the stuff and where i got my fondness for sucking stuff
sorry that was both disturbing and illtimed well i guess ill never talk to her but maybe next year at our 5 year
damn i need a date
oh but you dont really show up to 5 yrs with a date thats more of a 10 yr sorta thing
im kinda curious to see who else from highschool is a rough rider
ive only heard about like 3 people comming out
i just read my horoscope today and it said dont even think about working today you have no focus
and man is it right
im psyched i have an out now
if they ask me to do something ill just be like
sorry cant i got orders
whack smack what was that darkwing duck is on the attack
this is where youll find him at
fighting crime like a maniac
does anybody else remember that commercial my friend tine and i in 8th grade had a little dance to that it involved slapping jumping and some tush flailing
wed do it in school all the time
i got my mattress yesterday and it rocks my boxers
if any of you reading this are cute boys feel free to come over and check it out
i went out to a bar around the corner last night with spark
after buffy hes like do you wanna check out neighborhood bars and who am i to pass it up it was kinda fun but kinda dead cause it was tuesday and everything
2 days til olympic fever its a disease im gonna print out a pretty schedule when im through with you brats
oh shit i think i found a lump in my luging ankle the olympic fibrosis is already starting stage two is curlers wrist then the dreaded sequining of my clothes to be like kwan
i may just go get the bedazzler to make it easier
be like kwan be like kwan
i just got my delayed hangover i almost booted in the bathroom before
this sucks i dont understand i was doing so well this morning wakin up on time etc
damn its like a kevin costner movie you wait so long for it to come and when it finally does youre pissed that you were born
i gotta give a shout out to my coworker for that one
i came up with the analogy but i was constipated on who would be a good actor to name so i asked tim i think its the six pack of amstel and 45 glasses of red trying to tell me something
i forgot to mention i think the funniest one liner last night was made by pawn
the bud light commercial was on where the girl was preparing the room for sex
and shes shouting down to her husband that theres candles and satin sheets and finally bud light then he runs up while stripping and dives on the bed but slips out the window
so were all laughing cause its pretty funny and pawn was like its funny cause its true
my best showing was probably in the car when we were talking about the show i dunno i think its called elimidate
so pawn was explaining the rules and hes like so theres like a guy and 5 girls
and im like oh ive had that nightmare
well i gotta go now
it only took me like 35 mins to get in today
woohoo and it only gets better cause i had to walk to my car this morning
but that in and of itself was great
i live in a city now and walking around at 8 in the morning people are everywhere
i had a blast yesterday
i went with my new roomate spark to his friends place
it was just cool hanging with other gay dudes
i was cracking up the whole time they were really funny and i was on as well
not to mention that the supertybowl was awesome
and the couple whos house it was loved football
which i found cool i like well rounded asses
every time someone would come on screen we would shout out hey look its
and then put some weird name in
which was really funny drunk
the rams coach was called everything from wilfred brimley to dame judi dench to marky post to rerun
add in some tightend humor and drooling over tom brady it was a laugh riot
we were talking about valentines day and if spark should get his boy of 2 months a gift
pawn suggested that it not be too relationshippy
i started cracking up cause im like you should get him the protrim and you can be like i saw how your eyes lit up when we watched that commercial
well all in all i am happy about the move
i think im gonna go get my computer today and my mattress comes tomorrow
happy friday im happy and also in possession of certain keys to a certain apartment
woohoo now i can go anytime i want its like i live there already
wait i paid rent so i do live there
took some measurements last night and it looks like the bed frame i want is out
im upset but ill get over it
im probably gonna have to do the bed in a corner thing to get the desk in there and my sister was like you dont want to close it off any more with a footboard itll make it look even smaller
fuck her for being right
but it does save me like 4 large is large thousand or hundred i think its thou but i mean hun
so now when i get board today at work im gonna cut out little shape for furniture and play puzzle with graph paper or possibly go to target to look for plastic i want to make this shower curtain out of 4x8 plastic rounded rectangles that are connected with loops
im thinking green with a strip of blue at the top and one second from the bottom
all in all it comes out to 8 rows of 18 columns
its like 144 pieces and 414 connections
but i think itll look kickass
i think im gonna have to cut up folders or something its impossible to find sheets of plastic
well be in good spirits and have a blessed weekend
this week has been insane at work
it the end of year for us on friday and i need to get all this stuff done
but i still steal a minute or two to move over some more old posts
if you notice to your left there are some posts archived by month
did you catch 24 last night
i was iming with some guy so i wasnt giving it my undivided attention but it was good
well i hope that these posts pick up
whered the funny go i guess beat out of me by work
but crew class starts monday so thats cool
i hope its fun and helps me keep in shape
hello all ive been itching to get back into the blog thing for a while
its been a 2 year vacation
well get into that shit over the comming weeks
i guess i should introduce me
old gay guy in dc from new england
ive been here for just under 3 years
i love it and think ive found home
so im thinking about moving all my old diaryland posts over but thats gonna take a while
some day maybe you can check them out
i was thinking about neglecting to move the selfimportant or selfloathing or otherwise embarrasing posts but thats not real also the template is under construction and i dont really know my blogger shit so its gonna be handicapped for a while until i get into the swing so bear with me
awesome its a four day week then a four day weekend then another four day week
wahoo i cant even think about working right now
blah blah im so not into it
i was laying in bed last night and i couldnt fall asleep i thought these damned cicadas were only suppoesd to make noise during the day
i guess that was a false
well i gotta get back to work
i was on the connecticut posts site wondering about the recognition of massachusettes marriages in my home state
the i came across the message board
i was so angered by everybodys use of god in defining civil law that i needed to respond
this is what i said lets not stop at denying samesex couples the right to marry
lets deny all people the right to marry under the law
if marriage is such a time honored religious institution then the government state or federal has no place to recognize it
lets establish civil unions blind to race gender etc
to establish stability in household and the rights and privileges guaranteed to present day married couples
then the church can have its marriage thus averting the apocalypse that so many people have been referring to
and the religious right can continue along its morally superior discriminatory path to save us all
religion has no place dictating the lives and lawful actions of those in a society founded on the principle of religious freedom
that it is already ingrained in our everyday lives is not a sound argument for perpetuating its presence
the only purpose it serves is to alienate those who do not believe in the judeochristian establishment thus infringing on their religious freedom
government should be secularized and god should be removed from the public sphere
i have had this song in my head for a few weeks
things have been going cool here for a bit
i finished my rowing class and met a lot of cool people
i start for real in june
um im almost finished transfering all my old posts
so i get my lsat scores back next week and ive been all over this forum where people are talking about admissions etc
on the site people have been recounting their testing experience and trying to remember any question they can
through this i think i have built a false hope that my score is good since i always seem to get the answer ppl on the forum think is correct
which is cool but now im nervous
to top it off and not in the good way i have heard from numerous sources that they hod gotten their scores early
this kinda frightens me since i was prepared for them showing up on the 6th
cross your fingers and hope for travey
im finally home well at work
ill lay it down for you
firday i do almost a full day of work
and get a ride to the airport at about 8 car
this i hop on my 35 minute flight to newark plane yeah i know it was dumb but flyi
com doesnt start flying to jfk till next month or something
after taxiing and everything it took about 2 hours
then i hop on a shuttle to grand central station bus the jersey transit system in their infinite wisdom decided that only one lane was required for entrance into new york city
so my 35 minute bus ride took 2 hours
i get to the train station and look for the next train well this was convenient there was only one left
i had missed the 1122 and the 1222 so its the 130 for me
i dont know if any of you have taken the 130 outta gct but unless youre intoxicated its not fun
its like the drunk tank at county does anyone know what county is just sounded like somthing perry mason would say or better yet matlock
to top this off there was a phish concert in nyc
and if you know anything about me you know i dont like phish
so me on a train with a bunch of drunk and high kids
to top it off the 130 makes every stop through to connecticut so my 45 minute ride train took 2 hours
finally i roll into trumbull at 330 and get to sleep
saturday was nice the wedding was pretty and stuff
i really wasnt feeling the catholic sercive although who does
honor this and serve that and make him a cheese sammich woman
the reception was cool very italian but i ended up making friends with a cousin of mine that i havent seen in like 8 to 10 years
danced like a fucking freak caught holy hell for that the rest of the weekend
but sall good when the three of us todd traci and i get together its in good fun
went to bed at like 2
open not really a golf fan but the weather was incredible and its just overall a cool experience
kinda bummed that phil doubled the 17th but ehh
there was some good golf played
this is a conversation i had with my brothers fiancewhile whatching some guys put on the 16th green
meg wheres the hole trav megan you gotta remember these thing jeeze
meg do you know where the hole is trav i got a couple ideas
we got outta there at like 745 crammed 4 people in the back of my sisters pathfinder
and started a horrible trip through long island
4 hours later and about 50 miles we roll into manhattan and drop off todd and megan
then we trade off and each drive a bit
my shift came on at 130 and was the last leg
i was so tired being in the sun all day and all
finally roll in at about 330
all in all horrible trip but some perspective it still was shorter than my trip up there
felling good nina simone birds flyin high you know how i feel sun in the sky you know how i feel breeze driftin on by you know how i feel its a new dawn its a new day its a new life for me yeah its a new dawn its a new day its a new life for me ooooooooh and im feeling good fish in the sea you know how i feel river runnin free you know how i feel blossom on the tree you know how i feel its a new dawn its a new day its a new life for me and im feelin good dragonfly out in the sun you know what i mean dont you know butterflies all havin fun you know what i mean sleep in peace when day is done thats what i mean and this old world is a new world and a bold world for me stars when you shine you know how i feel scent of the pine you know how i feel yeah freedom is mine and i know how i feel its a new dawn its a new day its a new life for me free styling oh im feeling goooooooooooood
i took the lsat monday
the culmanation of a 2 week blitz study session
i dont want to go out on a limb and predict my score but i think that ill be at least comfortable with it
the testing environment was much better then oct
02 when i last took it
this time i think im ready to make the plunge hopefully i can get in to the schools i want though
but i have 3 weeks to obsess about how i did and you know me
ive already established a y group to try to compile everyones memory of the exam so we can see if we got questions correct
so far ive gotten most of them right but im not sure about this one about health education and propaganda
anywho thats all i got to say about that
on another note ive been talking with this really kick guy on im but he knows about this site so i wont go into detail about this
if you want the skinny you can contact me
also ive been really blah at work an im going to connecticut this weekend
im really hoping to slow down for a bit next week
so i was sitting on the john the other day and it was all rocking back and forth
a few months ago the landlord changed our toliet cause it was leaking and causing problems int he apartment below
since then it has been a little less than stable
so while i was using the facilities the other day i reached into my 5th pocket on my jeans and pulled out a nickel and a penny
i was able to shim the nickel in the from and the penny in the back
now it doesnt rock anymore
also i got my lsat scores last week
also 6 days until i go on vacay to san fran im wicked excited
i hope all yall emailed your senators this week
ive been watching cspan all week on the fma debate
so i found this site in a gay magazine
added to the fact that theres some nice dick on it
its a great waste of time
i posted one of me
my friend from cmu is comming to visit today
im psyched cause i havent seen him on about 3 years and ive never seen him gay
well i guess he was always gay but i didnt know until last year
oh yeah and hes super cute but thats besides the point
i hope we have a lot of fun
well have a blast on rms its hellaaddictive
master seaworldpictured above with willyis the town hero and if anyone thinks different then prove it

until i can figure out how to put my pics up this website is well dead
but i wanna give a halla out to every one have a good spring break
after complicated research and many nights awake so many questions trying to figure out just where exactly did crotch goblins come from
but i finally figured it out
jessica simpson and nick lachey
of course how could i be so blind for sooo long
we must put an end to this terrible creature
but how do we do it
that is a good question mate
but jessica being so fucking retarded we can just lower her in by giving treats and lead her to a bear trap and wham chop her head off
now nick being the intelligent one of bunch we presade him by telling that john reed is in his bedroom nick will be very excited then run to his bedroom and then we take a gun and shoot him when he enters
we the people are the only possible source with the technology to stop this awesomly bad things
join me my friend into elimating these critters
thank you for your time for this imformation
thank you and good bye
once apon a timethere once was a very angery kid named john reed
john was always angery about the dumbest stuff
one day he disobeyed his parents and turned on the t
john wasnt alowed to watch t
v bc it made him even madder
so he turned the t
john got soo mad at the charatersplots and pokemon
he got so mad that he got up and got this dads golden gun and went down stairs and then he got so mad that his special ablity transportation came upon him
he was then transported to the world of pokemon
so he went around the crazy forest and short wild pokemon
so then 3 days latterjohn was getting pretty fed up of eating pokemon so he went out of the forest and desided to find ashthe star of the t
v series he found him playing with pikahu on a park bench in the city
he walk up to ash with the gun
ash who had never seen a gun or gold before in his life
ash asked him if was a fancy mustard holder
johnof coursesaidyeah of course it is u loser
so ash being very hungery took the golden and stuck it in this mouth and shot it
ash died with a smile on his facebecause of his love for mustard
so then pikahu sat here laughingcuz he had always hated ask but just never expressed it
for pikahu was a weedheroin dealerand had been slipping ash huge amounts of cystalmeth ever since they had met
but ash had become amune to it so it had no effect
so then pikahu said in a deepbig voicesaidlets get outta here and have the time of our life
so john transported him and pikahu out of the t
v in time for dinner
from then on john kept pikahu in his closet and made him be his slave rat for the rest of his pokemon lifewhich is foreverunless shot
at age 101 john was on his deathbed with pikahu chaned to this sidepikahu was cleaning the bedpansof course with the last bit of effort john took out the goldengun and told pikahui am taken u with mehaha
iii bang they both died at the same time but he dint even use a bullet
thats because in the door why stood the secert agentmr
linscottbut he had only used one bulletand they both had been shot
and the romm was like john on bedpicahu on light standnext to the bed and mr
s standing infront of them both

me and my people in the ghetto support all the ghetto police in the world and the ghetto of lexingtonthe home of the white dogz
this is the fan club of john reed
in most of the casesi dont use last names but this time its special

danielle wanted me 2 make up a story so here it is
once upon a time there was a place without guns
now this place still wasnt all that peaceful for the replacement of guns they used sticks instead
anyways there was very few critters in this mysterious land without guns
this story takes place with a couple crittters named master seaworld and myran
both were not very bright
but together they equal one brain
walking miles though out the dessert master seaworld finally reached his destination of his life time
it was times like these master seaworld charased these moments
so when he got there he took a dump and then left with satisfaction
when he got back tired and ready for sleepies when he entered his room he found his buddy myran
master seaworld being a reasonable man
said not today myran im excectionally tired and want rest
so myran got mad and ran away
but came back an hour or two later
master seaworld was still exsosted from his trip
but that didnt stop myran
he ran up and jumped on his bed screaming i want pan cakes finally master s got up and made pan cakes and slept on the couch while watching he favoritist show ever franklin the turtle on nick jr
all of sudden outtda now where myran ran up with a stick in his sweaty palm and started beating master s 2 death so master s finally died

there once was a baby named bo jangles
when he was born his parents were told that he was blind but bo wasnt blind
the doctors were foreign and they believed that he was blind because of this really light colored eyes
while growing up he tryed to convince his parents that he wasnt blind but they would never listen
so he started to pretend he was blind
the only person that believed him was a kid named johnreed
both of their fathers were highly involved in the mob
organized crime while johns dad was the boss
bos dad was the right hand man
so there familys were really good friends
like family one day john was making fun of bos blindness by throwing a apple at bo at a mob meeting
then john asked bo what color his hair was
bo was like brown freak
john realized how cool bo was and they became best friends
yeah so they got like lost a whole bunch
so one day bo jangles and johnreed were on there way to the gas station to pick up some tacos
they desided to take a short cut throw the corn field
and geuss what they got lost
so they started going throw the corn rows when all of a sudden they spoted a sign
it read dont mess with the crotchgoblins
john reed siadcaitlin kylethis girl school is always talking about those things
all of a sudden a cgob bounced on bo jangles head and hiss at him
bo took the cgob and took it off his head and took a bite out of it
taste like some sorta weirdness
i dont think u should have ate thatstupidsaid johnrxxd
i dont care bo said
all of a sudden there was a nosie coming from the corn rows
what did u do to my cgob it was caitlin hey caitlinsaid john
nm which one of u ate the cgob
did u realize that was the last one left bo siadsorry i didnt realize it
caitlin runs over to bo and beats him up
caitlin then realizing that it didnt really matter ask them why they are in the midddle of a corn field
john answers we were on a qwest for tacos but we got really lost
i can i join i think i could help
they answer yes and continue on there mission
day turned to night and they began to get tierd
they could barely see anything when they walked rightt into a man
the man was really tall
bo took out this keyring flashlight and tapped on this back
it was bob the janitor
what are u doing in the corn field
i am inside of bob u know using his body reallysaid bo
since u have found out my secert i will send u one person to help u
the 3 kids huddle togther to think of a person
o wait i only now one person
i only have one friend
i meet this girl playing online bingo a while ago
i told her i had no friends and she told me that she would be my friend
i will send her to uthanks they siad
all of a sudden a girl appears and jeepers creepers flys away
aww one mintue i am in bed the next in this corn field
you all have some explaining to do
they expalined all to danielle
so i geuss i am stuck with u guys saids danielle
i geuss its not all that bad
after a while they all got disscouraged and begun to believe they were lost 4ever
but while walking through the corn field caitlin tripped over a bar typed object it was a water spicket
they all took a drink
and then all went to sleep
the next day when they woke up they figured out that the wtare had been magical they all had turned multcolored
but the effect wasnt perment
they continued on there qwest
they found a small shack
they all could barely fit into it
it was filled with cotton candy
there was a little boy inside he had big bug eyes and he also had lazyeyes
so one eye was on the cotton and the other on the unexpected geust
the boy said in a small voice you will forever remain in this house for life
all of a sudden the doors and windows dissappeared into nothing and they all look at each other in puzzlement
what are we going to dosaid bo
i do know i know i am eating some of this great candysaid danielle
they all sit and eat the candy
the boy then explains how he got lost one day and found the house and has been stuck in there for the last 12 years
wow that is amazing i guess we will be here 4ever then
at least we arnt alone
are parents are going to be freaked
it will be okay i think
4the next 100 years they ate cotton candy and played 20 qwuestions
but they did in the end go insane and become addiccted to bark

hmm thats when i became very curious
could this be ashland a ghetto only there was one quality missin
i saw across the street from my cousins house
a old man wearing mix match clothes it was neon green shorts and a red top that made me think

47 hours over in 3 2 1
hard day that sure was bydanielle
c2004 john reed was never interviewed
there once was an cover up organization kinda like aa or anger management
it was supposed to deal with people who had cross eyes and who were ashamed of them
but that wasnt the real reason
it was to find out who had murder fiar larwence
the group met every wednesday at the the local bar
well the leader of the group was a man named county paris
county paris had the crazyest lazy eyes ever
the group was comprized of many tpyes of people but they all had cross eyes and they all wanted to find out who had killed fiar larwence
all they really did at the meetings was get really drunk and sing elton john songs
the group would most likely get into fights and claim that raddishes would take over the u
so they went to jail a lot
but it was all county pariss fault bc he though it would be a good idea to get drunk at the local bar
but in reality county paris just liked to get real drunkbeacuze he missed his really old friend fiar larwence
he had been shearching the internet for rumors of he fiars death
and one night had mad a big big break through
the group was meeting at the local bar and the county was sitting down with this wirerless laptop
he typed the words i killed fiar larwence on ask
the county had been in luck there had been a website made that day that had to deal with someone claiming to have killed county paris
what a dumb personparis declared
lets go you guys he is in mansfield ohio
lets kill himhahahhahahah they hitched a ride with a gay truck driver
so it took them 5 days to get to mansfield and when they did they had to find the man who had done it
so they askeda round and round tryed to tap peoples phone
one day they jusrt happened to be on marion ave and there car broke down
so they all walked up the closest house on the road from were there car was
county paris knocked on the door and a strange friendly guy answered the door
ummm our car broke downgood man could you please be a dear and let me use ur phone the name is myronand no u cant because i deep fryed the phone this mornings o it doesnt work
but if u would like to come inside and have dinner with my family i would be trilled paris said ok that is very nice do u have enough room for all 12 of us myron saidwe can have dinner outside
the name is county paris no mr

ohhh oki will get out the tomato soup ummmm declares john
hes on crystal meth he doesnt know what he is saying
okwishpers paristhey u dont know a man by the name fiar larwence do u i think john might i have heard that name before

john saysdad they are not kun fu lessons how many times do i have to tell u that
the point is that u arnt dead and that the gargen wasnt messed up
they burn the body and then they make some tomato soup
i loove tomato soupdeclares john
and life goes on just a normal day the reeds the end by danille
so there they were in the cotton candy shack
johnreed caitlin danielle and the weird little kid
ever since they had been trapped in the shack their brains had been on over drive trying to think of a way out of there
but of course the naughty bo jangles wasnt thinking cuz he was withdrawing from pot and cuz he is dumb
bo wasnt helping at all cuz he kept saying here was like no way out and that they would all die
and all of a sudden out of no where they started to hear the jeepers creepers song so of course they got a little freaked out cuz who wouldnt
but danielle assured them that jeepers creepers wasnt going to hurt them but instead help them
bo jangles being his stubborn self didnt believe what danielle was saying
so bo got on the ground and started to gnaw on the bark floors and chant ignorant things
so caitlin went over to him and slapped him silly
so of course jeepers creepers showed up and brunt holes into the shack with his eyes
in no time there was a hole big enough for everyone to get through
but jeepers creepers sensed fear in the little boy and he liked his bladder so he had to the little kid against the will of the others
but jeepers creepers who was not bob anymore but a canadian organ grinder
so the group thanked jeepers for getting them out and he flew away into the sky
so they returned to the qwest to find tacos
about 30 mins later bo jangles gave out a scream of pain
he had been bitten by a bug
johnreed being an expert on bug bites had seen this rare bite before
it was called a boss bug and if it isnt cured it could turn into amys disease which john had done a prodject on before
since they didnt have a can of tuna or a cacti they were going to have to let bo go through the horrible disease
so what else could they do aww yes return on their adventure
after an hour or so bo becamewell to be very blunt bossy
he was telling everyone what to do and all of that kinda of stuff
so everyone decide to plot against him and put oragel in this mouthwhich would make it num and stop him from talking
john tricked him into drinking the whole bottle by telling him it was toothpaste and that his breath smelled really bad
being so full of himself he took it all in
after he had done so he looked like he was retarded
so they were still wondering through the corn field but much fastercuz bo couldnt tell everyone he needed to go to the bathroom every 10 mins so he peed his pants a lot
then out of nowhere in the middle of the corn field was a tall man who was about 7 6 and was wearing a black trench coat and his hair was gelled back
he looked troubled or like he was in shreah for something very important
the group approached the man
they asked if they could help with anything
the man asked if they had seen e
caitlin brust out into laughter and told the man pointing to john that john was e
john tried to tell him he wasnt but the man wasnt going to take no as an answer
the man told john that he just wanted to make sure he was ok and that he wanted to make sure that e
t was happy on earth
the man kissed and hugged john and then saidfairwell son and good day john was pretty weirder out but he passed it off
by time the man had left the numbing gel had worn off and bo jangles began to act like his bossy self once again
but not only was he being bossy his ego began to grow bigger and bigger
it was the size of a hot air balloon
he started to say that he was better then everyone else
so everyone was getting pretty hungry and to their surprise in the middle what would lie but a meatloaf restaurant
when they walked they noticed the banner above their head it stated that the meatloaf was magical and that it was abundant and free
so they sat down for a wonderful feast of meatloaf when u guessed it bo jangles began to fight with john
saying that he could eat more meatloaf then john
so boof coursed challenged john to a meat loaf eating contest
john accepted because he is johnreed the kunfu master that will never turn down a challenge
so they had the contest
bo ate 15 loaves and john ate 3
so bo jangles went around celebrating his victory over john
but soon he got sick and puked out all 15 loaves of meatloaf
everyone started to laugh except bo who started to cry and he had a pity party for himself nobody else joined cuz1
they were eating magical cheesecake and real cherries from the garden outside
so after the cheese cake and the party was over they continued on their journey
nbsp after a while bo was so over whelmed that he fell into to the ground and began to say really crazy thongs about mongooses
so john being john had a little talk with him about his attitude
but bonbsp wouldnt comply so john poked a presser point on him and they left bo jangles to die in the corn field of never ending corn
nbsp without the presence of bo jangle the group seemed to be doing alot better then they had been doing
as the day turned to night they got tired and made corn beds like the indians made and they fell asleep
they were awoken the next morning by the screams of john he had had a bird poop on this face which was really nasty and gross
but he wiped it off with a cob of u guessed right corn so after a breakfast of creamy cornby the way john had begun to get a yellow tint to his skin
lolthey continued on the qwestit wasnt to long before the corn ended and a street was now in front of peeps
they started to walk down the road when they noticed an aldis grocery store
they walked in looking for someonenbsp so they could ask where the heck they were
but as soon as they walked in who else would appear but the naughty egotistic bo jangles
nbsp everyone was in shock
how did he manage to get to the store before they did
l bo jangles explained that as soon as they leaf him aliens abducted him and did weird things to him like put silly putty in his brain and dye his liver purple
but that they had to stop and get some raisins
so they let him go cuz they were done with him
besides the fact that no body believed in him
but they were pretty mad at him so it really didnt matter
so bo had a dollar so he bought a bottle of ketchup
and john remembered that he had a dollar in his shoe so he bought a container ofnbsp mixed nuts that were also meat flavored
so they left the store while the girls were still trying to figure out where they were
but nobody seemed to know
so they left in disappointment while angry drug users tried to sell them street drugs and highway streets
but danielle insisted that they had 2 of everything
so as the girls pushed the crazy people out of the way they rejoined the guys who were enjoying their treats
bo opened the ketchup bottle and took some in and spit it back out cuz it was horrible
so bo jangles marched back into the store and complained about it to the person in charge
the sales worker took out a pistol and told bo to get out of the store if he didnt want 2 unwanted presents
bo sulked out the store and he shunned the store
he came out while the girls were making fun of johns mixed nuts
john being an awful nice person offered to share his new found treasure
but everyone declined even bowho would get anything
it made john kinda mad but the wonderful taste of the meat flavored mixed nuts made him forget about his sorrow
nbsp while walkingnbsp down the long street john decided that it was time for a sing along so he took out his banjo keyring but bo that it was a ghetto idea and then insulted john by telling him that he was really ghetto
john not like being called ghetto for any reason got mad and bit off 2 of bos fingers and ate them
bo was in a world of pain
not to mention that the blood was everywhere
but nothing could really be done
bo in a word was handicapped and mad
i wounded why so danielle and caitlin played doctor and wrapped up bos flesh wound
but somewhere in the middle danielle went over to talk to john about the wordghetto
which didnt make john to happy
soon the 2 were fighting over ghettosreal or made up
but they came to a tie bc danille changed the subject to bo
john still mad said he was sorry to bo
nbsp but bo was still really mad at john for what he had done so he wasnt talking to him
so what else could they do but continue on there qwest
bo still upset started to sing the songstacys mom
everyone thought it was kinda weird and sick but nothing else could make the sad boy happy
so then john got mad bc he saw a pile of rocks and he got depressed bc he thought even a rock whould reject
the girls tried to tell him different and hold him that he was not acting rash
so then about 2 days passed when they came across a road that intersected with the one they were on
the road was named ocean ave
john got really excited and started to jump and scream and lose control of everything
john finally got control and told his peeps that road ended in his back yard and it was only about 4 miles and that they were going to be home by night time
and was good because they were tired of liven in the presence of corn and need to take a bath
bo jangles bc he smelled of puke and ketchup
and when they got there all of there parents where there and they all acted like nothing had happened
but nobody wanted to ask qwestion
the only person that had gotten in trouble was john bc all of the parents had come up with this crazy idea that john had kidnapped all of them
so john couldnt watch the scifi channel or any other channelexcept weather for a year
cuz he must have seen the prank on some movie
and nobody wanted to get into trouble so they just agreed that was what had happened
so they all made it home safely never to tell what had happened i think the only qwestion was did bo and john make up well thats a story for another time

geuss what i figured out ow to put pictures on the internet via my digital camera just not on this web page well all u have to do to see them is go over to the side bar and go to my links and click on my pictures
there will be more to come if u cant find the links go here
its been a while since i ever use a blog again
kind of lose the last blogger that i used last time
today is the meet parents day
and of course im included
as usual though coz almost everybody else have to go miraculously my father decided to sent me n my mother to school
it is unusual of him to do that since he always prefers staying at home and sleep all his want since it is a day off for him as its the holidays for the students and he need not teach well its been raining ever since i woke up
and it only stops until now
the weather is kind of cool
pretty good for time to take a nap
felt like cuddling up my pillow n goes to sleep
but alas ive to go to school in such a weather
and redeem my results slip
cool as it is bright as it seems
but thereisnt alot of students around that time
guess every other students chooses a time as early as 10 to collect theirs
and only a couple of unlucky teens like me choose such a time where everyone is back at home watching tvs and enjoying themselves
45 am is the time
the first thing i saw when i entered the school
was dt with 3 other pupils
yep all 3 of them are from my class
dont know whats up with them
as far as i know they must have commited something wrong that dt wanted to see all 3 of them
and from their faces they arent looking kinda good
trying not to be nosey i dragged my mom to my class
where mr wong my form teacher is
well guess we were the last ones to be seen
ok its my sort of fathers sisters son
well i dont know how to call it a longdistance relative maybe anyway he was there
at first glance i thought it was my aunt
but then again when they came out it was not
it took about 15 minutes for them before they come out from that room
and when they came out his mother greeted my mom
and then when we entered the first thing mr wong said wad your related one ar and i nodded
it doesnt looks pretty nice
oh well guess ive to buck up for my final year
just like what i did last year i aimed to get back my position for top 10 muahahahaha
i always get a pretty lousy results for mid year examinations
and only when final year then my results are of the better
this year im not going to let my parents down either afterall its an important year d mr wong goes on and on about how i can improve on it
and im determined to prove that i can do well
and i am made of something lolx
he even suggested me to buy the ten year series books to practise on
and oh yeah he even asked for my home number
i sure hoped he wont call when im least expected
after all im a good student yawn
guess ive got to stop
im so bored with nothing to do now
maybe i should go back on reading the comics
and i just cant wait for tomorrow haha coz im going out to redeem the jolins concert tickets
well lets hope that at least i could get them
today planning to go orchard to redeem my jolins mini concert tickets
never know that there will be so many people redeeming it
i went out at noon
then when we reach there it was around 1pm
and when we got there
i am utterly shocked theres already a long queue there
god why am i always so sway but then i was prepared for the worst
i knew even if i queue up together with the others i definitely doesnt stand a chance
and just to make myself feel better
i decided to catch a movie yep and i wanted to watch the day after tomorrow
then we decided to see which movie comes first and decided on which one to watch
and in the end shrek 2 shows at 1
30pm and dat is at 2pm
and i was like oh man
then i started to begged her on watch dat instead
then after some convincing hehehe i finally talked her into watch day after tomorrow instead woohoo jiali rulez lolx anyway as i was saying
we bought the tickets and we have about an hours time before the movie starts so we went to isetan which is just below the cinema and shop around
haha weve been to many departments
and like i said theres a doll which looks really like jiali muahahaha
oops hope she isnt reading thisand i told her that and she totally disagress with me
anyway we went to the stationary department and i finally found the black shaker hehehehehe well i know i am wasting money but this is the only way to make me feel better after the loss of the 2 tickets for the jolins concert
and time flies it is almost 2pm when the shows going to start
so we decided to go and make the preparations like buying popcorns
lolx and then we finally entered the cinema
wow the shows really awesome its the best movie i ever watched and jiali even wanted for the toilet
but i told her not to go
coz if she were to leave her seat at any point of time its gonna be another great scene that she missed and finally she tolerate through the whole movie
and its absolutely a nice movie so stimulating and romanticfor some parts
especially how the girl hugs sam when he was freezing cold after coming up from basement
and the most thrilling part is when the huge waves of seawater came rushing down to the city and everyone is running for help
except for the girl who tries to help the old lady getting back her passport
then sam came to her resuce
and they are safe and sound its really a cool movie like what dt have said
haha after coming out of the theatre the first thing we did was rush to the toilet and god we didnt even manage to finish the popcorn we left about 12 of the popcorns
coz both of us were to full to continue eating
and after sometimes i keep talking to her that how great the movie is and i am so proud of myself that i told her to watch dat instead of shrek hehe no la
lolx anyway later we went over to heeren and planning to go over there and do some shopping
but then as i passed by popular i decided to stop by and buy a couple of assesment books for myself
coz my grades really have gone down and i must do something about it this june holidays haiz
that means its still looks like schooling for me
after that we went over to heeren
and on the way jiali stomach pain
told her to go toilet first liao she dun listen
like i always said whenever you need a toilet you cant find one whenever you dont need one it keeps appearing and i was absolutely right about this she refused to go at first and when we walked half way and about to heeren she suddenly stomach pain then she say she cant stand it and have to go for the toilets
and luckily we reached there and she took quite a while before she comes out
and i was starting to get bored too lolx finally we went to hmv
i was looking for the marykate and ashleys vcd
hoping that the price will go down
but instead the vcd is gone haiz
then forget it we headed for the bus and went back to bukitmerah interchange to buy me and my moms dinner
and then we went back home
oh yeah i forgot that i need to buy the lime magazine where this month features quite a lot of my favourite people in it great really sway ar today forget it haiz
oh well me go have dinner liao
wahhhh i cant believe i am sooo unlucky remember yesterday i said that i was going to orchard to redemm my tickets well yeah indeed theres leftovers for the tickets in the hello shop
i got the news from an email sent by my online friends
they said that they came even at 4 somethingwhich was the time when i went there again the second timeand they could redemm the tickets without fear argh i thought with such a queue surely the tickets have been out like hotcakes but no and worst of all they can choose whatever they want not according to the amount of people and most of the people chooses other merchandise like the dvd and posters and the passes
thats why theres so many leftover tickets but then again when i read on with the email i realize something no wonder the people dont want the tickets if they had the tickets they have to apply for a new line and that means they have to spend more money for a pair of ticketsand it is not worth it at all thats why almost everyone want something else geez now that i know the truth about iti wasnt that upset over it
coz even if i got the tickets i couldnt have gone to the concert without applying for another line
moreover ive already got the dvd
i dont see why i need another one
and for the passes erm i dont kinda have the time to queue up with those fans to get just the autograph of jolin so i think i will pass up that too lastly for the limited edition poster
its kind of waste though
but still then again even if i got the poster i would just throw it one side like the poster doesnt exist
so after all these serious thinking i wasnt that depress on them
afterall the best thing is ive had a wonderful time in orchard thats the most important thing
oh yeah i got the news from a friend in the japanese exchange program that may and her partner got a tiff over something
ha serve may right hey im not being mean here
but she really deserve that since sheve been acting all the while trying to be teachers pet
and always acting cute i cant stand people of this kind and god she even cried muahahahahaha my friend did absolutely the right thing ha know what she did she actually treat my friend as her maid she kept ordering her to do things for her when my friend herself needed to do her own
and she even wanted my friend to help her keep her dirty clothes while she bathe how could she and thats not her first time according to my friend
thats why my friend could tolerate no more and quarrel with her good job hehe and she even dare to complained all that to e and a shortforms
then they told my friend about it
thats how she learnt that
and for 2 solid days whenever may wanted to talk to my friend she ignored her
wee way to goi bet may definitely doesnt have a good time in japan hahahaha thats something glad to hear
and to think she was still looking so forward to it this should teach her a lesson oh well
going to catch my favourite tv shows
havent been writing for awhile lately eh haha early in the morning go down the road to hop on my fathers car and nearly tripped on a couple of invisible stones it is camouflage in the grass by the way
thats why i didnt notice it
and somehow it is still early and of coz the sun hasnt risen and neither could i see clearly
thats how i almost fell
luckily i regain my balance as soon
and my father also grabbed me just in time my knight in shiny armor lolx
well first thing in the morning nearly tripped
what more comes next yeah i know theres bound to be loads more install for me and i was quite right if you ask me when i got to school
everything was still allright until the last 2 periods first was the chinese our chinese teacher told us that were not allow to use the dictionary coz we already know whats coming out for the test so she forbid us from using it
and then she didnt turn up today for our test but the test still is carried out somehow with another teacher of course
and fair enough we got the same topic and hehe ive memorise everything though ive changed some of the words coz i cant seem to remember all
oops i started it quickly
coz we dont have much time after we came back from the com lab
and it left us about 20 minutes to complete it instead of 35 but half way through the teacher told us we can use the dictionary my mouth dropped open i thought didnt she told us we cannot use it how come now can use ohnbsp well after all ive memorise most of them theres no further need for me to get a dictionary now
since there isnt much to be look up in the dictionary
so i quickly finish the letter writing and was the second to finish but wasnt the second to hand it in
coz i dont want to hand up a piece of work with mistakes so i counter check it
then the teacher broke out the news that we are having another letter writing test on the upcoming tuesday
and this time it is the formal type
and we are asked to learn the format ourselves
but as she is kind she decided to go through with us on behalf of our teacher
and we were asked to stay back after school for 10 minutes to go through it
but the worst has yet to come she decided to run to ask the hod of chinese department whether she can ownself conduct the extra lessons with us and then when she ask whether she can trust us on not copying when she leaves
and she choose to trust us i couldnt believe that and when she left everyone started to take out their papers and copy
and everyone manages to finish it somehow
chemistry is the next lesson
i hate it coz that teacher totally sucks he teaches so quickly and when students ask questions about it he will yell at them how weird and he always like to pass sarcastic remarks on those he dislike thanks god he dont dislike me
he actually treat my classmate a ghost and he likes to give nicks to anyone he hates and sway
when he tested us on the equations i got picked coz i was 16 and 15 didnt come so he decided on 16 then i go up shaking
dont know what to write
i look around asking for help
got some help from some of them and then he decided that we can get help from someone
and if we cant complete it by today all of us have to stay back inorder to get everyone safely back home i quickly ask the chemistry experts true enough i got the answers
but whether or not its right he didnt say
but for the other team he didnt got it right and somehow have to stay back for detention
i thought he was going to say who was the other one that was up there that couldnt answer the question just nowme but i was standing there praying hard he wont
and whew he didnt i think he either forgotten about me or i really did get the right answers
kinda sway today right but i cant wait for sunday coz id be going to the library and borrow some cool books home
and i cant wait for wednesday night either coz my brother is coming back and then i can finally get my hands on the gifts he is bringing back hehe
i sure hope he got the things i like
weee today is a saturday and tomorrow id be going out
ok can anyone enlighten me here has to how i list other peoples blogs on mine as i cant find anywhere where i can do it its probably staring me right in the face cause sometimes i cant see for looking kate
just read this that someone posted on the os is it me or does he mention 3 different releases here
from ross halfins diary on his website thought id have a lazy sunday
checked my diary and realised the person who does it hasnt put any recent pictures up
speak to phil collen havent spoken to him in a year he tells me theres a def leppard greatest hits cd coming out for christmas again and a rock version of vault
he thinks the record company are flogging a dead horse and hes had nothing to do with it
hes in london for a couple of weeks
told him joe had played me the covers album theyd done
phil seemed very disheartened by it all
i must say theyve done a great version of rock on by david essex wont tell you the rest as itll spoil it
def leppard greatest hits cd 2
rock version of vault or does he mean the above is a rock version of vault 3
covers album why would they release 3 all round about the same time although not sure when the cover album is due they ought to call one of em dazed and confused cause i know i am lol
i cant believe the weekend is nearly over i havent done anything hardly apart from recover all day yesterday from friday night out with the girls then got rid of 5 black bin liners of crap from the spare bedroom today where it came form ive no idea as it doesnt look like theres less stuff in there
oh well feel better for the clean out
didnt have the internet last night as hubby was messing with the cables i felt so lost i didnt realise how much i use it and depended on it have i no life lol kate
driving to work i saw this sky tv van parked at the side of the road i nearly crashed the car as the paintwork on it was huge leopard print covered every inch of it it was soooo cool
im so glad its friday its been the longest week of my life
ooh i cant wait till tomorrow is over and the weekend is here its been one hell of a week at work for me everything has gone wrong it got so bad at one point i could have said stuff this and walked right out
my friend just phoned to see if i want a girlie night out tomorrow night
you bet i do yeahhaaa
well i thought it was about time i started a blog seeing as it seems to be the craze of late dont know how it will take off i might even get bored at some point with it but we will see
for shear genius foucaults pendulum swings ellispses around the da vinci code
the protagonists of foucaults pendulum try to prove a point that the afficiandos of the knights templar would believe anything
so they make up their own phenomenal history of mancomplete with prophesies and death rituals
they soon find themselves pulled into the maddening world of cultists and true believers
and of course satanic death rituals
for genius and plot foucaults pendulum stands heads above the code yet it suffers one fault the book is long and tedious
i suspect if i really got into masonic writings and long conspiracy theories i would find it all long and tedious as well
three quarters of the way through the book i was fed up with all the cultist idiocies and just wanted the book to end
theres a large number of people who would believe anything you stuff under their chin
now get to the end
it is interesting the way that people really want to believe in big plots and grand theological conspiracies
even more interesting is the way that many people really want to play a part in the great fictional dramas
they kidnap young girls they fly planes into buildings because they feel they have to somehow be a praxis in the grand social movements of time
they read pieces of fiction with their eyes curled up as they ride trax to the towering granite ediface in the center of town believing that it will give them some secret hidden powers over their enemies
for those who are wondering
if you ride inbound trax you will often see people reading a strange book with their eyes curled up as they try to conjure the hidden powers between the words of the book
i was watching one of these creature one day
the creature was literally shaking as he read
he suddenly developed the most sinister grin on his face that i had ever witnessed
the creature closed his eyes and lipped the words he found
ingraining them in his memory
i was obviously witnessing the birth of a great political strike against this creatures enemies
the creature got off at the towering granite ediface stop
there are times when i really question why i live in the place where i live
i like the mountains and deserts but i really have a hard time working for people ruled by revelation
in many ways i agree with orson scott card that science fiction really is one of the best formats for exploring theological concepts
when accepted as fiction the format really lets our minds explore different ideas
we can connect absurdities like umberto eco
the open acknowledgement of a scifi book as fiction lets us see different ideas without the precept of having to take them for anything more than entertainment
the method works best for people who see all of the wonderously different ideas that can exists
fiction can open our eyes to the way the world works because fiction allows the author the ability to really focus in on ideas that nonfiction lacks
yet there is also a strange point where cultism theology guruism and pure fiction collide
this is what i find troubling
we create a fiction then people build on that fiction
they destroy that which does not fit in their world etc
i guess i should mention when i was reading foucaults pendulum i had a rather dull witted boss
he could not understand the ending of the book
caught up in the strange cult history portrayed by the book he could not understand why umberto eco ended the book that way could there have been any other way the ending seemed obvious from the first page
there was just the game of connecting dots and seeing just how the predictible ending would come about
in this regard the plot of the da vinci thriller was better designed
we did not know the true identity of the grand villian until the last chapter
more of a thriller the ending was quite interesting in that after the villian was unveiled all of the strange creatures in the book turned out to be normal people
while the ending of foulcaults pendulum comes off as a let down
even worse some of the normal people suddenly seem like monsters
i finally read the da vinci code
it was a fun fast paced read
it was much better than digital fortress
in the da vinci code dan brown put together a nice coherent plot likeable characters and enough controversy to get people talking
apparently people are eating the book up
it has been in print for over a year and there is still a waiting list at the library and used copies of the book have not dropped to the dollar level which generally happens as a best sellers move into the yesterday news category
overall i found the book a fun work of fiction that provided some interesting insights into my favorite characters of history
i do have to admit
in many ways i am turned off by the message from many pop books and movies that paganism is somehow a superior more rational and or more balanced form of spirituality than christianity
yet overall i think the primary message of the book was on target
the book gives a strong reminder that the victors tend to rewrite history
trying to actually base our life on any form of ancient writing is rather foolish as ancient writings have been seriously manipulated throughout the years
the political forces of the dark ages led to a systematic destruction of the science and culture of the ancient greeks
the destruction was similar to what we saw the taliban doing in afghanistan and we see the islamic clerics doing in iran
in order to add more legitimacy to one set of books and icons there is a concerted effort to destroy other competing systems of thought
as for people destroying history for religious reasons here in utah we actually have an extremely large and powerful university that actively works to falsely interpret the history of the maya aztecs and other native americans to fit what is most likely a fictional account of the americas
to add an element of conflict to the da vinci code dan brown gives the reader the grand daddy of all conflicts
the conflict between man and women
the primary premise of the book is that the vatican has conspired to destroy the sacred female
the priory of sion is actively engaged in trying to preserve the ancient religious texts that hold a different role for women
the idea of a central conflict ruling the entire history of mankind is extremely compelling
this is much like what hegel was doing with his philosophy of history
he had the world moving through these thesisantithesis conflicts
claiming to be a scientist and claiming his conflicts were scientific hegel gave the world a very compelling history
having fictional scholars speak authoratively on a controversial subject is a strong literary device
i can see why the book shelves are now full of refutations of the da vinci code as the different fictional accounts of history battle eachother for supremacy
a few days ago i saw the tale end of an interview by richard rubenstein for a work called aristotles children
i placed an order for the book and am looking forward to its arrival on my doorstep
if we really want to look at fundamental conflicts at the foundation of society i think that looking at the ebb and flow of interest in logic is far more telling indicator of the progress of civilization that the conflicts of religion
it seems to me that when there is a due appreciation of logic the society rises
when the society is dominated by revelation and mumbo jumbo
well my webhost was out for most the day and all my sites were down
fortunately i am finally back up
there error messages were all saying that the disk on the host was full and all database connections were consumed
nbsp so i am left wondering it it was a problem with my code gone wild if it was a simple hardware failure or if another site on the web host having problems
my logs did not show unusual activity
there were several malformed bots on my sites today
days like this make me wish i had access to the server
looks like blogger now has a program to add comments to entries
nbsp its typical about a month agonbsp i finally sat down and wrote a program to track blogger comments
oh well i would rather use the blogger program
nbsp anyway i just changed my profile and erased the links to the small number of comments that were left on my site
i apologize to the two people who took time to respond to posts in the past
i just made my first electronic quarterly tax payment with the irs eftps tax payment system so i saved a stamp saved cliff clavin the effort of sorting and delivering mail and saved the effort involved in having an office federal letteropenerperson open an envelope
nbsp having done all that i now need to make my complaint about how stupid it is that we pay taxes on estimated amounts
i havent a clue about how much money i will make this year
nbsp if peoplenbspvisit my get rich quick scheme i might get richnbspquick
in allnbsplikelihood sanity willnbspprevail and i willnbspkeep having to work temp jobs for food
nbsp personally i think the best way to handle taxes would be to define a special tax account at a bank
taxes would be assessed as money is withdrawn from the account
if the taxes were taxen out automatically as we did our day to day business people could better manage their tax liabilities
rather than playing this silly estimating and tax return games that the irs requires
this is cool the www
sc service will show you the number of times a domain is listed in dmoz
the format of the url is www
com shows that my little math site is in the directory
oddly this info is hard to find in dmoz itself
searching on a domain name does not always return a result
i suspect however that this is only accurate relevant after a directory crawl
on 77 i added to the community directories sites for glenwood springs colorado and colorado springs
glenwood springs scored high on my list of place i would evacuate to if i left salt lake
of course i continue the process of spreading myself too thin
i added colorado springs because about every third link i find when looking for web sites in colorado seem to come from colorado springs
being a cad i spent the last two days dropping in the ad layers for the sites
i will have to start adding content
the left believes that we should centralize power through ever larger government bureaucracies and controls
the right believes in centralization of power through market manipulations and corporate consolidation
hmmm i wonder where the people whonbspbelieve centralization of power itself is the problem are to go
the two new get rich schemesnbspinclude a byu cougars gear page and a back to school page
nbsp last year the attempt at a back to school page netted zero
quite frankly i think people have too much garbage
i stuck a silent plea for people to ride their bikes to school as opposed to driving
as fo the byu page being a u fan i think it would be an absolute hoot if it made any sales
if i succeed i will need to treat myself to a beer
i agree it is stupid the way that everyone spends so much of their day running around trying to make cash
i wonder if the message think more spend less could perpetuate itself when attached to an ad
ive only seen bits and pieces of the hype surrounding the 911 commission report
everything ive seen has got my bogus meters flashing full
the main gist of the 911 commissiont is that there was just too much of that freedom thing going down in the united states and now we a more powerful centralized police to protect the nations interests
yep theirnbspconclusion seems to be to do unto the us what al quaida wished to do unto the us
the report claims that 911 was a failure of the imagination
then they go on to report that the security expertsnbspare nownbspimagining things much worse than 911
the implication is that we are much greater danger because security experts are imagining more
if anything there is an reverse relation to what the security experts imagine and our overall safety
the fact that people are much more attentive has increased security
now the fact that we are activelynbspengaged in a war means that security risks are greater
what the experts are or are not imagining does not dictate the extent to which the us enemies wish to do us harm
the experts imaginations affect their attentiveness
it does not affect the sentiment of al quaida
the big failure of the pre 911 world was not the lack of centralization of security forces nor even the imaginations of security experts
it is the fact that the us and the western world had turned a blind eye to the oppressive regimes overpopulation and disaffection ofnbspthe islamic world
if the puppet governments in iraq and afghanistan simply turn into the corrupt nepotistic regimes that the us has installed in the past then we have two new breeding grounds for anti american terrorists
just as the corrupt saudi arabia was the breeding ground for the 911 terrorists
if we end up with states like those put in place by george bush the first then america is in deep trouble
between now and the next war the technology gap is likely to lessen
heres one for the shrinks
anyway i dreamed that coco a medium sized black dog had a zipper
for some odd reason i had put my shoes in the pouch behind the zipper
nbsp so i was was walking along
suddenly i was innbspa fierce winter storm
nbspi decided that i wanted my shoes but coco would not let me unzipnbspher zipper
she kept curling up and chewing on her legnbspeverytime i tired to open her
nbsp deep down i think this dream is my subconcious telling me that dogs really do not make very good luggage even though they are just about the right size for carry on
i caught the end of le tour france on cable
i have to admit that cycling is truly a beautiful event
watching the waving motions of the peloton is truly hypnotic
ive always seen cycling as a lone wolf sort of sport
it is a challenge against ones self
i enjoy being way out on an empty country road cycling by myself grooving with nature
i never really understood why there were teams or why people bothered competing
quite frankly in recent years ive been extremely turned off by the utah mountain cylcling scene imoab
com which is into this extreme tear up the desert free falls down the face of cliffs
yes mountain bikes can do as much damage to the wilderness as a jeep
or a stick of dynamite
i tend to limit my mountain biking to roads
trail ride does too much damage to a trail
the mountain bike is the best way to experience canyonlands or the swell
but theres enough roads already in existence
i dont need to carve a new one with my fat tires
anyway seeing a well formed peleton is rejuvenating
i can now understand why cyclists go through all the hassles of the professional racing circuits to build up the skills ncessary to ride in such a formation
the race itself forms a work of art
if i were to try and ride in such a formation i would twist the wrong way and knock everybody down
they other cyclists would get reall upset
oil prices hit historic highs
the stock market seems to be in a free fall as a the result
the one biggest fault that i find with the bush administration is that it is not using this increase in oil prices to push for long term reduction in our use of oil
conservation is not simply about having less
it is about structuring our lives so that we get the absolute most from the resources that we consume
in this regard i think the steady increase in gas prices is actually healthy for the economy since it is focussing peoples attention on efficiency
for that matter one of the first jobs i had was to use information technology to help reduce the fuel consumption of a fleet of trucks
the rising cost of a resource created a need for people to figure out how to get more from the resources consumed
i also had temp jobs in construction
the firms i worked for were actively eying the cost of materials
when the cost of wood was high they would employ people to salvage the wood
when it was low the wood added to the landfills
pulling nails from lumber is not the best job but it is worthwhile in that it shows a tendency to maximize the return from invested resources as the price of the resource rose
i think it is the nature of humans to become destructive when the price of resources is too low
anyway hopefully the rise in the price of fuel is getting people to think about ways to realign their lives and businesses to be less dependent on oil
is is possible to shorten the commute or perhaps it is possible to own two cars a economy car for every day travel then the gas guzzling jeep for rare excursions sadly our fearless leader is not really taking this opportunity to push long term conservation
oil prices are rising and bushs circle of oil buddies are getting richer than ever
bush looks at the economy
his circle of friends is getting richer than ever before
nothing wrong here as for my get rich quick schemes i really should call these a get to minimum wage quick scheme ive added a back to school page and a earth friendly products page to the various web sites
in my attempts to put your money where my mouth is it seems that what i should try to do with the sites is emphasize quality over quantity and sustainable living
the income side of the equation is still too weak
ive been very good about lowering expectations but the old income seems to be lowering itself even faster than the expectations
anyway i end up wasting the first several days of each month brooding over the income question
yuck anyway i was thinking of concentrating the money making schems in the area of personalized products
the area of custom engraving is a place where the internet can excel
at least marketing takes up very little brain cells
it just eats up pride
of course none of the other little projects are going that well
i keep finding areas that i need to research before completing any of the other sites
a lot of people believe that an employers decision on hiring a candidate depends on just skills and experience
well they couldnt be farther from the truth because that is false
here is the truth skills and experience within your profession arent what gets candidates the job
the truth is that there are too many candidates with the proper skills and experience to get the job and only one usually gets the job
companies are looking for more than skills and experience these days
so its extremely important that you all your individual characteristics mirror your passion
so what are the other factors that are usually invisible to candidates selfawareness who are you and where are you going what are your plans for the present and the future how do you know what you want how do you know that youre right for this job employers want to make sure that youre not lost
learning skills are you willing to learn are you current on trends and technology are you a person who loves to grow within their profession you want to show an employer that youre a candidate that learns in order to progress your career
adaptability with everything changing so rapidly today its possible that tomorrow your skills may no longer be relevant
are you a person who adapts well to change character do you show passion in your industry because when you do it projects through your rsum cover letter and especially during the interview
an employer wants a dependable trustworthy employee
the more you project your positive character the better you can have a huge advantage over your competition by going one step
create a career portfolio and within it make sure that you showcase all the categories above in the proper manner
i guarantee that this will give you a major edge over your competition
so you see that its not all about skills and experience
its really important that you consider the factors above because them alone can get you the job

emailing may seem simple but there are some complications that you need to be aware of otherwise your email may never be read by an employer
your subject line is crucial how would you like the employer to be drooling to read your rsum of course you would right because that will increase the likelihood that the employer will read you whole cover letter and rsum
note an employer usually takes 10 15 seconds to overview a cover letter and read it
it is to your advantage that they completely absorb your cover letter and rsum
the subject line of to your email can create this urgency this excitement and this greed within the emotions of an employer
to give you proof of what i just said what motivates you to read most of the articles that you like to read i bet its the headline
nine times out of ten if the headline doesnt interest you then you wont read it
its no different with an employerthey are human just like you
we read what we want to read and what we read usually strikes our interest
tips on writing a magnetic headline write a subject line addressing the company needs not yours
i have accomplishments to provide value toward position put the employers name in the subject line notice the cliff hanger as well ex
hi dave i love your product and i would like to work for stir the employers emotions by teasing them with value
here is how can increase your sales by 8 ex
how would you like a lawyer who has won 98 of the time ex
i am used to communicating with dozens of people who recommend me to other friends
houston we have a problem with spam filters according to time magazine between 4070 of all email is getting killed spam filtered before anyone has a chance to read it its true you may think an employer is getting an email but nope it never reaches the email inbox because the spam filters stole it like a thief in the night
what can you do to make sure your email arrives to an employer you have a choice
you can ask if the company uses a spam filter or you can assume that they do
i dont know the exact statistic for the exact number of companies that use spam filters but i would make an educated guess that its 50 at least
i would say that your best bet would be to prepare for the spam filter
the spam filters have a point system
now usually when a email has more than 5 points then your email will ether not make it to the inbox or it will be place in the spam filter folder
to give you an example on how the point system words if you have free anywhere in your message and especially in the subject line you will receive 2 points automatically
there are many words that trigger points and its way too long and boring to go through all of them
so here is a free resource which detects your point system of an email lyris
how should i send my rsum before i begin writing about how to send your rsum it is critical that you always include a cover letter with your rsum
thats right even when you send it through email
you actually have a choice
you can send your rsum and cover letter in the body of the email or as an attachment
beware sending your rsum as an attachment could cause it to be scrambled or lose it format structure during its journey
this means that an employer wouldnt be able to read or have trouble reading your rsum
so how can prevent this from happening send an email to yourself
com to get a free email account from each
then send your rsum and cover letter from one to another and see whether your rsum and cover letter are formatted correctly
should i send my rsum and cover letter in the body of the email or as an attachment i recommend that you do both
that way you know the employer will be able to read it no matter what
check with the email content checker above and see whether your email with the attachment has under 5 points
if not then i recommend that you send two emails to the employers inbox
the first has the attachment and cover letter and resume in the body of the email as well
then send another email with just the cover letter and resume in the body of the email

there are over 6 billion people on earth and to no surprise there arent 6 billion jobs to equal the score
as a matter of fact there arent even 1 billion jobs in the world today
what does this mean for you you have plenty of competition in your industry and the numbers arent getting any smaller
there is a new person born in your industry every minute
so for you to stay in the elite crowd or join the elite crowd in your industry you have to create what i call a distinguished identity
what makes you special in your industry what have you done that very few have done in your industry what can and what will you provide on a guaranteed basics these are all questions that employers want to see within you
the job of the employer is often tough because they have to search to find out whats within an individual
the employer or recruiter has to search if nothing stands out to be beneficial to the job
most employers are to mature to go hide and go seek so dont hide behind the tree
the key is to make yourself into a shining bright light like the sun if you will
make it easy for employers to see your benefits and they will find it much easier to hire you
what is one way you can separate yourself from the crowd and become the first star to shine bright at night let me tell you a secret did you know that fewer than 15 of people who have a career dont have a career portfolio
i willing to bet that in your industry its way smaller than 10
what is a career portfolio a wellprepared portfolio that provides evidence to an employer of your accomplishments skills abilitiesit documents the scope and quality of your experience and training in the proper manner
a career portfolio reveals everything an employer wants to know about you
remember an employer usually doesnt hire an individual if there are unanswered questions
so you want to make sure tat every question is answered promptly vividly and clearly

proof shall set you free put yourself in the shoes of an employer or recruiter for a minute
looking over hundreds of applicants they always have a problem
which is a major problemthey have no idea which individual has the best package to deliver
thats why there is an interview to choose that one person
who is the person that gets the job the individual who show the most proof that they can get the job done
what shows proof to the highest degree during a job search without hesitation its a well organized career portfolio
employer moto you can have the skill and have plenty of experience but you still have to prove that youre worthy of the job
are you waiting for a promotion a popular question in the job industry is how can i get a promotion or how can i get promoted faster here is the simple reply to that question create a career portfolio that exemplifies your skills experience and most important accomplishments
let me ask you a question why should you get promoted if you cant at least show what you have accomplished your reply to this question may be they should already know since ive been working there for so long
this is not the case
the bottom line is this companies dont record what you have accomplished
they just evaluate whether youre doing the job or not
your accomplishments probably go way beyond what you have done for the company
and guess whatyour company or association definitely doesnt know about that
so always keep a record of everything that can be tied to your profession
are you in need of a raise in salary who wouldnt love to receive a raise the real question that you need to answer is why should you receive a raise in salary one of the hardest aspects of a career is getting that raise
the more value you bring to a company or association the more you get paid
you can have the skills and experience but that still doesnt answer the question why should i give you a raise here is the solution to getting a raise
you have to prove to the company that you can provide more revenue or value then a normal individual
just to give you one quick tip on how to distinguish your value from others create a career portfolio and within that portfolio compare your skills to other people who work in your industry
that way you eliminate the work for the employer
now they dont have to figure out whether youre worth a raise because you have already showed them proof of why youre worth more than the average person
remember it all starts with providing the company with more revenue or valuethat is the key

the person who always gets a good job is relentless and persistent in getting the job
the person who goes an extra mile by doing the unnecessary
its the person who goes above and beyond by doing something different or unique
we have been playing by the same job search methods for years
but i found out a startling pattern with the people who bend these traditional methods
the traditional methods are creating a resume cover letter or filling out a job application
is there a law that states that you must not go beyond these methods of course not i recommend that you do more by striving for what you want
i guarantee that you will get noticed just from being unique
now im not saying just do anything to get the employer or company attention
you want to think of create of ways that you can show that value that you will provide or the accomplishments and results that you have accomplished in your track record
let me give you a few examples that are rarely used spice up your resume or cover letter by including a testimonial
have a current or past employer give you a testimonial based on your skills and accomplishments
im telling you that this will strike the interest of any one who reads your resume or cover letter
come in with a plan
nothing rocks a companys or employers boat like a person who comes in with a plan that will increase the company or associations revenue or productivity
take a moment and brainstorm some ideas that could improve the value of the company you are applying for
it will be well worth your time and effort
be included within the top 5 by the followup
yes about 95 of job seekers usually dont follow up
remember that companies hardly ever hire a person in just a few days
it takes weeks to fill a position
so guess who the employer will remember the most when the time comes to hire that one individual
its that person who has multiple exposures
always remember that our human mind stores much easier from repetitionso dont be afraid to follow up
you can really crush the competition with a career portfolio
yes it doesnt matter what industry youre part of you can create a career portfolio even if you havent been working for long
your portfolio doesnt have to be about how you perceive yourself
you can use the leverage of others to create the ultimate career portfolio so your career can continue to grow and prosper financially over years to come

i think its about time that you tap into the mind of employer to explore their needs and wants
after all they are the individuals who hire you
if you give an employer exactly what they need and want then you will get the job
can i share a secret with you that very few people realize you can help control a persons decision by creating emotion
the kinds of emotions that you want to create in an employer are excitement and curiosity
primary emotions feelings during finding an employee boredom lets be honest
reading hundreds of documents about people you dont know or care about can get very boring especially when over 90 of rsums are terrible by providing very few benefits if any at all
confusion reading hundreds of rsums that arent equivalent to the position needing to be filled causes confusion
urgency employers need help and that is why they are hiring
they realize that they have a position to fill as soon as possible and the longer it takes the more money or productivity will be lost to the company
your objective is to cure these emotions for time that the employer takes to overview you as a candidate
you want to provide an antidote with your words
how can you do that now that you know an employers habits emotions and desires so now you play the right cards
the best way to change someones habits is to interrupt their pattern
how can we interrupt an employers pattern interrupt their present limiting pattern of association to create new results
tony robbins you can interrupt an employers pattern by giving them what they want
instead of boring an employer make them curious
instead of allowing employer confusion provide them with clarity
recognize their urgency and provide them with excitement by providing a solution
when doing this correctly the reader will love you and reward you david green is an author and hiring manager of distinguish marketing llc

wow what a nice concert
the texas am small ensemble class was performing some classical pieces and one contemporary classical as i might say today in st
i was first bored to death hearing the notsocoherentlyplayed flutes clarinets oboe and stuff played at the beginning of the concert
just as i was thinking of leaving the concert well i was also trying to decide whether im going to kneel and making a cross sign when i leave or not since i was in the church but not in a mass so there i was sitting so everly confused and bored with all those tuttyfutty flutes and clarinets
then just as i build my strength to get up the music proffesor introduce the last group of ensemble which is the trombone ensemble
i was like wooowww forget the kneeling forget me leaving cause im staying
then this trombone ensemble start to play man eight trombone players set like a whole orchestra with the high middle and low arrangement thing
godd the play took me back to my junior and high school time
i remember just how fun it was to play my trombone with thw whole brass section
anyway the last repertoire thay played was a jazz music
ok its jazz and trombone together heck im staying till the end of the show
maybe i shouldve read the program before the show anyway the piece was perfect
i was clapping without thinking like when i was deciding to kneel or not
then i went to talk with one of the trombone player
so then i decided ill take the class this summer however i still have to look for a slide trombone since my trombone is a valve kind
shoot i wish my birthday was in may
i got this from tania
go to google then search for weapons of mass destruction and click the im feeling lucky bar dont hit enter

tarombonbsp went to st
mary this monday cause i havent been there for about three weeks or more
the theme that day was about honoring grandparents
so at the end of the sermon this new priest i dont even know his name told us to say in our heart the name of our own grandparents
now i see a problem
i only know my paternal grandmother
ive never met my mothers parents and my fathers father
im trying really hard to remember any of their names
i remembered my fathers grandfathers name johannes which is really rare for an indonesian name
i think its because at that time catholic has become a common religion in the area where my father came from so they started using their baptist name
so i went home while trying hard to remember my grandfathers name
today while browsing at my sisters happily neglected web site i found this tarombo which is the family tree from my fathers side
so i hurriedly look at the name of my grandfather i read it and i found it to be another european name but right next to it his indonesian name is written in parenthesis raja doli which is my middle name
since i came to america ive never used my middle name anywhere or just put an initial anytime i need to fill a form requiring my middle name so its been five years not hearing people calling me with my middle name except whenever i meet this brazilian friend of mine who calls me by my full name everytime we meet
but i hardly ever meet that guy anymore
now i remember that my father told me when i was a kid that my grandfather gave me his name
i used to ignore that story but now i see the story in totally different way
hah ive been getting three emails with the same link httpwww
com from three different friends from three different countries to see the cartoon about the presidential election stuffs in america

david sedaris the antonia vardalos of bestselling author growing up im never good with peoples name
i used to address all my teachers by the subject theyre teaching miss biology mister math and stuff
its not that i dont respect my teachers but its just hard to remember peoples name that you dont see at least 12 hours a day
i dont even know the name of those new emerging bands whose songs i like and remember all the lyrics
when somebody told me a joke about how you can get around when you meet an old friend but forgot their name so you say
so how do you spell your name and your old friend would say b o b and you say ahh
i thought there was a hidden m there i was thinking of using it whenever i meet old friends without having any idea of what their names are
however there is an exception on this bad habit of mine after i finished reading me talk pretty one day by david sedaris
this book is so hilarious that whenever i found myself laughing in the lab while waiting for some experiments i turn to the first page and read the authors name again so whats his name
after finish readig the book ive been rereading the authors name for hundreds of time hence i can finally remember the authors name
and while reading another book written by this author i figured out his family has major resemblance to the family in the my big fat greek weeding movie by antonia vardalos
no wonder i like this book a lot
how did i forget all this aromatic alkane conformation and stereoisomers naming for chiral carbon nbsp as i go through my old notes on organic chemistry i found an interesting thing in the way im thinking
as i remember when i took the class all i care was to memorize them before i take the exam on the next day now as im rereading the material im wondering of how long did it take for chan ingold and peng to analyze the chirality of alkane to come up with their stereoisomers naming system and what analysis method did they use to figure out
and also how much research on the thermodynamics and kinetics involved in measuring the stability of one molecule conformation and how do they come up with the idea that the stability of a molecule depends on their conformation

the 6th floor last month somebody in the 6th floor of richardson killed himself
my lab is in the 9th floor which means everyday i passed the 6th floor using the elevator
since im a chemical engineering student while most of the people in richardson are petroleum student i dont know what really happened to the guy
last night around 10 pm i dropped by the lab to get some samples to do sem on and left the lab around 11 pm
when i got into the elevator i looked at the digits indicating the floor youre passing on the elevator door
somehow i started to think about the incident as i watch the digits changing and it has been a habit for me to count the floors all the way to where im going
so it went from 9 8 7 and then it stopped at 6
i waited as the elevator door slided open
i think i kind of close my eyes halfway and try to blur my vision so that i wont really absorbed the spookiness or any specter flying around i know i felt really stupid
than the door opened perfectly and a man came in
his feet touched the floor
i asked him if he knew anything about the news he said yes

its just a sad news for people to chose to stop their live for whatever reason
i know there are a lot of obstacles pressures and other problems people encounter and we sure will in this life but there should be some options even just one option for people to chose other than killing themselves to lessen the burden theyre having

procrastinatus meaning pro forward crastinus tomorrow or some other time in my case ive been meaining to use the bet machine since last two weeks however it was always used and a week ago it broke down so i keep putting the experiment off for quite a while now
so now im waiting for shane to come back from germany to take a look at the machine
until then i can procrastinate on my experiment with a valid reason huahuahuahua
today i felt like a dependable master student hahaha the feeling that i havent felt lately right after i defended my thesis
i had a good doze of xray diffraction discussion with john
i think i helped a bit and gave some comments from my research experience
now thats what i called a good learning experience
anyway i think ill head to rec center for a couple of laps in the pool and the running track now that dan is off to somewhere weeeeeeee
the art of photoshopgraphy just playind aroung with a photo
the devils went to nawlinnbsp
lowcarb madness has anybody noticed that almost all restaurant now have a special menu for the lowcarb dieters which for some of them it means taking the buns off the burger and keep the price unchanged
i guess its like a fashion trend this year its the carbohydrate next year its fat depends on any dietrician who comes up with a bestselling book on how to lost your weight
anywayyyy i tried the c2 coke today or as i like to call it a dilutedcokewithanequalmolarofwateraddedintotheregularcola kinda drink
i guess now people wont fell guilty if they drink two can of c2 cokes at a time since that will be equal to one can of regular soda
what a great tactic to sell more sodas i admire those marketing peoplehuahuhuahuahua
songs stuck in head heaven by los lonely boys and loves divine by seal
ive been trying to look for the cds everywhere well mainly in half price book store being a poor graduate student and still i cant find it
right now ill just wait until one of the radio stations play the songs
yesterday the song started playing as i parked my car
i just sit in the car until the song ended right in the parking lot
i do that a lot hahahaha
sometimes i wonder if that count as craziness
i took this picture from a plantation house located right in the middle of baton rouge and new orleans
this is the free standing stairs of the house
i didnt use any flash to get the picture and it was around 3 oclock in the afternoon
as the lady in the tour said the stair can be a good background for a wedding picture
stairnbsp now that the colour of template background is black i thought i should put some of the black and white photography i developed from back then heres one of them
new orleans trip wow great weekend getaway
a view of the mississippi river a long island ice tea in the bourbon street and a nice plate o
two plates of beignet in cafe du monde
happy 4th of july more on the story later
i had a dream after coming home from houston last night i was starving
i didnt have a chance to take my dinner before we went off to houston
during the game i didnt buy any food in the stadium
jamie brought a plastic bag full of candies that keeps all of us happy during the game its kinda slow for me and there only was one homerun by the astros and they switch the pitcher clemens in the middle of the game but still its interestingso yesterday i just ate four candies drank a bottle of milk and a bagel for lunch and one plate of egg salad after i got home
so i was pretty much starvig when i went to bed
whenever i feel hungry while im sleeping i always dream about eating some foods and wake up feeling even hungrier
last night was kinda a different dream
i dream of eating my home country food with my family and i started eating the food with silverwear but after a while i use my hand to eat the food instead of the silverwear and it felt really good
i guess i was hungry and homesick at the same time
the good thing is ill get to visit my home country this fall yeeee
braves just got back from minute maid stadium in downtown houston to watch the baseball game with the whole office group minus henry and john
plane trip tomorrow cant wait
ultimate frisbee just got back from a three hours game of ultimate frisbee
me james shane sam and prasad against jamie and melodys undergrad
too tired cant move a lot
within the next month i plan on registering two different domains and creating websites for each
one website will be for the computer science club that ill be copresident of next year current site httphpcompsciclub
com the other site will be for the final fantasy xi clan that ive become a coleader of current site httpfoxknights
i designed both of the current sites but i want to be able to do things that free hosts wont allow php scripting custom email addresses etc
maybe ill even migrate this blog to a subdomain to one of them to make image hosting easier
unfortunately i dont know how to do a bunch of the things that i want to do with the websites
thats the stuff ill be learning in indeoendent study this next year but until then neither are going to be all that different from what they look like right now
maybe ill start learning a few things before school starts itd at least give me something to do when i get bored
yeah i went to go see that movie on friday and ironcially im making this blog entry the day after tomorrow from the pov of it being friday
i know it sounds stupid shut up
it was a good movie and one that ill probably be adding to my dvd collection along with the 3 others ive seen so far this summer
the day after tomorrow is also when i start summer school
that goes until the 18th from 730 to 1245 every day but i get credit for an entire semester course speech so im not complaining
at least i dont have baseball to worry about this week in addition to summer school
apparently our series with kilgore was only a one game series instead of a best of 3
we lost last night 43 so that ends our season for this year
and if that wasnt bad enough our bus broke down while we were there
luckily it didnt take that long for a replacement one to arrive and i was home a little after midnight
time to go to sleep now
yep thats what mapquest says for the time to get from dallas to sulphur springs
now if we lay out the rest of the day on a timeline i cant quite figure out why were leaving so early 300 bus leaves hp 430 bus arrives in sulphur springs 730 game starts 930 game endsbus leaves sulphur springs 11001130 bus arrives at hp i do have to question the three hour gap in between us arriving there and the start of the game
we need 1 hour to warm up so i could understand 90 minutes to 2 hours
but 3 hope i can find a way to entertain myself ill be needing one
coach gibbins called my house today while i was out seeing shrek 2 which is just as good if not better than the first
we play tomorrow in sulphur springs 730 pm but the but leaves at 300
that means i have to be up at the school between 215 and 230 to get everything ready
this sounds like i might be the only student trainer at the game tomorrow
if wes is no longer going to be the varsity trainer and im therefore the only one itll be interesting to see how games after this week are handled
if we win this series well have games on days that im in summer school
games that are after 110 or that i have to leave for after that time wont be a problem but i dont know how state will work if we go that far since i doubt i can miss at least 2 days of summer school to go to wherever those games will be played
oh well i guess well just see how it works out
i know everyone loves to be out of school but it can get extremely boring sometimes when theres nothing for you to do
wait let me rephrase that when theres nothing that you want to do
i have tons of games downstairs that i could and probably need to play but i just dont really want to right now
i know that i didnt post yesterday mainly because nothing all that eventful ever happens on a sunday
my day pretty much consisted of going to church eating lunch and playing ffxi
not all that interesting to talk about
granted today hasnt been much more interesting
wake up go eat lunch and then come home and post this
yeah thats been about it
now its time to go try and find something to entertain myself
we won the series against mckinney 100 on thursday at the game i missed and 81 today so this next week well play kilgore
no clue where that is except that its somewhere in texas but apparently it takes a while to get there
from what ive heard the games will either be here kilgore tyler or some combination of those places
coach gibbins said that hed call me this next week and let me know the times and places of the games hopefully the times for the bus also
if we keep advancing the state finals are the 10th and 11th of june
apparently putting eye black on me is now good luck for the team
before the game someone pointed out that they won the last game they put it on me and now theyre 22
it doesnt really bother me i just have to remember not to wipe my face
this might be the last week that im able to work the playoff games since i start summer school 1 week from tuesday
i didnt want to have to take speech next year so my only other option was to take it during the summer
18 weeks i think ill take the 3
and for the record yes i did miss the bus yesterday
i got there at 500 and they decided that it would be a good idea to leave between 445 and 500
oh well at least i didnt get in trouble for it or havent to this point anyway
from what i heard we apparently won last night so there will only be the 400 game tomorrow unless we lose
went and saw troy today after school pretty good movie even though it did border on being a bit too long for me
next up shrek 2 sometime near the beginning of next week
angela claims that shes having a night swim party at her house on saturday or sunday although its most likely sunday for all of us i assume this means our u
she said that she would call me with the time so i guess ill see if she actually meant it or not sometime tomorrow
well i meant to update this daily
guess at least over the past few days it hasnt been as daily as the title says
2 exams down none to go all i have to do from today actually yesterday until tomorrow is just show up at school for any periods that i have a class
no exams but we have to be there for attendance purposes
today i have my computer science ap class i think were watching harry potter and cos for the two hour exam period
at least im taking my xbox and that dvd up to the school with that intent
my guess is that 5 kids out of our class will show up
granted thats an extremely high percentage when we only have a little over 10 anyway but well see
another baseball game tonight and no one thinks it is important enough to tell the trainer when its time for the bus to leave
500 530 400 ive been told all those times all by different people
my guess is somewhere between 500530 so thats when im showing up
if the bus is gone and i get in trouble for it its not like there was ever a consensus on when i was supposed to show up
if i do end up going it will be close to 1100 before i get home game ends 930 1 hour drive home then cleaning up the stuff and actually driving to my house
well i guess thats about it
time to entertain myself for about an hour and a half and then leave to go up to the school
really tomorrow is my only hard day of exams
heres our schools schedule tuesday 1st period exam u
history periods 36 2nd period exam precal pap tag wednesday 7th period exam english ap no exam in any ap class but we still have to show up periods 36 3rd period exam physics ap except i have to do computer science ap late testing at this time thursday 5th period exam spanish ap 6th period exam computer science ap friday 4th period exam theater arts long term project turned in today 8th period exam lunch varsity baseball plays this week on thursday 730 and saturday 400
ill be working both those games and the third if necessary
apparently no one thinks im going to be a trainer for varsity football next year which i am so a bunch of people got happy about that when i told them
we also have a picture for that during the 8th period exam on friday good thing i rearranged my schedule to have lunch then
for anyone that read my blog before this post it used to be at httpdailygoob
com now in order to be able to post images the address is httpdailygoob
com only the tripod site will be updated from now on so dont bother visiting the blogspot one
starting tuesday we have exams so ive been having to do exam reviews all weekend
i did do more than just that over the past 2 days though
friday right after school we had to finish filming our theater arts movie over at highlander stadium
there was a slight miscommunication between the athletic director and myself so i almost had to sign a 1 million dollar liability waiver
boyer help me take care of that issue
while im not going to name anyone specifically theres one person that in my group that i honestly hope i never have to see again after this school year
we also had our 2nd playoff game against hillcrest on friday
had a little bit of fun with me right before the game started so i took a picture when i got home and ill put it up here
we won something like 12 or 13 to 1 so we play against someone else this next week
not sure who where or if ill even do it since it will be in the middle of exams
edit heres the picture of what j
did to me at the baseball game on friday
i got quite a few comments about it
saturday started working on my u
history exam review since im not in ap
midmorning i left to go help someone get their dsl hooked up but i couldnt do any more than just get all the hardware set up since dsl wont be activated until the 19th
guess i know where ill be going after exams one day
i was gone the majority of the afternoon because i went to go see van helsing with my grandmother
i thought it was a pretty good movie i liked it about as much as i did the first xmen
heres the list of the other movies that were going to see this summer troy shrek 2 the day after tomorrow harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban the chronicles of riddick i robot the bourne supremacy king arthur the village nothing big happened last night i just played a little ffxi and created this blog
then went to sleep as my away message normally says
todo list for today finish u
history exam review change script for theater arts movie finish reading grapes of wrath upload picture from baseball and add it to this post get movie clip to andrew and yeah
i need to read the blogger help file this afternoon for uploadinglinking pictures
pretty sure its the same as normal html the rest of this markup is but i just want to make sure
why did i remember that i had a blogger account from 2 or 3 years ago all of a sudden not really sure
but might as well use it since im bored right now
for anyone thats reading this and doesnt know who i am im not entirely sure why youre here but feel free to keep reading
my name is jeff guebert my last name is where the title of my blog comes from courtesy of one of my friends about 10 years ago im 17 and i live in dallas
there you know me now
ill probably get around to writing a more interesting and longer post tomorrow
for now though its time to go to sleep
for quite a while the internet has been available wirelessly at locations known as hotspots which can be found in places like starbucks mcdonalds and airports
gprs and edge have allowed people to get on the internet anywhere that they can get a digital cellphone connection
take the availability of cellphone networks replace the necessity for a cellphone with a wireless card much like 802
11abg and up the speed to almost twice that of a t3 connection thats 802
this isnt the only new technology thats competing to be the next thing home users will use for their internet connection but with speeds and convenience on this level whatever technology end up becoming widely adopted will take the internet to a whole new level
i go through these phases of researching different areas in technology in depth so that a i can explain it to people if they ever ask me about it and b i can make a stronger argument for getting that technology in our house
anyway the latest of these research sprees ive gone on has been bluetooth
i remember about 12 years ago when this technology was first starting to be advertised by manufacturers but one of the major problems then was that products made by two different companies were not guaranteed to and often didnt work with each other
just another example of why i think standards are one of the best things that can happen in the tech industry
the uses for bluetooth are very impressive even though it is only considered a wire replacement
have a laptop and cell phone both enabled with bluetooth instant wireless modem via either gprs or edge
bluetooth headset acts as a speaker on pretty much anything that makes sound
more and more products on the market are staring to incorporate bluetooth and i wouldnt be surprised if eventually every single peripheral is completely wireless via bluetooth wifi or some other wireless standard
aka how to make my life miserable
so want to know the secret subway
i had subway for lunch on monday and thursday was the first time i could manage to even look at my computer monitor since then
im still not completely better although i can eat pretty much whatever i want to now and every once in a while ill have issues walking straight or standing up since im still a little dizzy
oh well at least its better than spending over 2 full days doing nothing but lying in my bed
summer and i really need to have a talk about what im supposed to be able to do and how im supposed to feel hint this isnt one of them
yep im done with all 14 days of summer school now and hopefully have credit for communication applications speech now
nothing left for me to do this summer except sleep play video games and go watch movies
oh yeah and hopefully be able to update this more often than once per week
3 speeches in a week should not be allowed
but unfortunately it is so that took up the majority of my time this past week
friday i saw the chronicles of riddick which surprised me by being a pretty good movie more on that tomorrow and worked on my grandparents computer
then i had to take the act yesterday go work on 2 different peoples computers and then today i went back to my grandparents to show them how to use the computer after i made the changes to it on friday
tomorrow i begin my last week of summer school which hopefully wont involve a lot of speeches
life lighten up a little
yeah been a few days since i updated
lots of stuff going on though
anyway let me think about whats happened
yesterday i had to give my speech over hdtv
i think it went pretty will everyone seemed to enjoy it and someone in my class even told another one of my friends how good it was
i get to give another one tomorrow over king tut which has to make use of a visual aid
hopefully that one will go just as well
tonight i tried to log into star wars galaxies to play even though i dont particularly like the game and enjoy playing ffxi much more but i ran into an interesting problem
somehow my account has been cancelled and i know that im not the one that did it
my only guess is that sony cancelled it after an inactivity period of what 3 weeks so they got an email from me tonight asking them to uncancel it
theres probably not a great chance that id be renewing my account anyway once my current subscription expires but if i have to jump through hoops to get my account activated again theres no way that im going to be playing this game that much longer
oh yeah and theres been way too much rain here recently
yep this is been a 123 weekend for me as indicated by the topic title
now for some more in depth discussion of each of these things 1 week of summer school down friday marked the end of my first week of summer school and the equivalent of the end of the 1st 6 weeks
my first real speech is on monday so i have to finish preparing for it over the weekend
it has to be an informative speech with no visual aid so i decided to do it over hdtvs
my second one will be on wednesday which is an informative speeck with a visual aid and i think ill do that one on either the egyptian pyramids or the sphinx
2 sat ii tests today i took my first two sat ii tests writing and mat iic
i could have done a third but i didnt feel like doing spanish and there was no way i was going to do physics
ill probably do 1 or 2 more at the start of next school year
3 for 3 on hp movies harry potter and the prizoner of azkaban definitely gets two thumbs up from me
it left out quite a bit that was in the book but since most everyone that is going to see the movies has already read the book the stuff they left out was fine
i dont know if i would say it was better than the second one chamber of secrets but theres no way it was worse
that about covers my weekend so far
nothing big planned for tomorrow except for working on my speeches but who knows what could pop up at the last moment
so i get out of summer school today to go eat lunch
wendys long line whataburger long line chickfila extremely long line mcdonalds 4 cars maybe theyre having problems due to the massive power outages weve been having but i went over there since i figured i could get my food faster
yeah it went faster but i was very impressed by the system they have set up
instead of using the normal speaker there were 2 women standing outside with pdas in their hands
2 cars at a time would give their order and it would be transmitted wirelessly into the kitchen
then they had a manager with a money belt standing near the first window so that both cars could pay at the same time
then each of the cars head to the second window to get their food right as the next set of cars is coming around
no wonder theres no line even chickfilas dual lane system doesnt work as well or else theyre about 100x as popular
still the point remains that i think this is an awesome use of technology and that more restaurants should make use of features like this
not just fast food but also places like chilis and other sitdown restaurants
waiter is ready to take your order he sends it back to the kitchen to speed up the process
need a refill on that drink give something to the customers so that they can signal when they need one
if restaurants started to embrace technology with ideas like this id gladly pay a few extra dollars each time i went there to help support the costs
10 years from now no telling how well be getting our food but i can assure you that it will rely on technology much more than it does now
yeah so 18 hours with electricity is the best way to spend the first part of summer in texas right right actually that would be a no
we had a huge thunderstorm cell come straight through the dallas area last night while i was out seeing miss saigon which knocked out our power until 400 this afternoon
2 days of summer school down and the class is turing out to be fairly entertaining
our teacher makes lots of jokes and tells us stories so it doesnt seem like were really there for 5 hours and 15 minutes
we start giving our first speeches tomorrow though but hopefully this trend will hold
i wont spoil it for any of you who actually think you want to go see it but trust me its not worth the 6 or 7 dollars to get a ticket
actually its the only movie this summer that ive seen which i wont be getting on dvd when it comes out as a result of me hating the movie see my note next to the terminal van helsing troy shrek 2 harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban the day after tomorrow the terminal wont be getting on dvd since its not a movie id watch all that often but it was still good spiderman 2 king arthur i robot the bourne supremacy catwoman about time to eat lunch and then im going back to cpl for a few hours
they better not be showing the village there
thats kinda how yesterday felt after my friend and i got to the hotel 30 minutes later than i originally planned we figured that registration would already be going on
it was a good guess if they had actually bothered to follow their schedule
the registration tables didnt even open up for another hour and 30 minutes then we stood in line 1 for about 40 minutes got our nametage then stood in line 2 for about 30 minutes more
note to cpl staff a schedule is something youre supposed to follow not just create and then conveniently forget
im probably going back again on saturday for at least part of the day maybe not all theres only so much i can actually do
tommorow i have the village to go see and ill post my thoughts on that when i get home
ive had this dvd for over a year but never got around to watching it until last night well technically earlynbspthis morning
while its probably not going to be a movie that i watch as often as some of my others galaxyquest the mummy returns etc
this has to have been one of the best nonaction and saddest movies that ive seen in a very long time
if you havent seen it and you can manage to sit through something where stuff doesnt blow up every 5 seconds definitely go out and rent it
cpl starts today so expect my post tomorrow to deal with my experiences that i have there
the numbers dont stand for quite the same things that they did the first time though
this time its 1 ddr party 2 ffxi websites and 3 extremely good movies
1 ddr party tuesday night sam had a ddr party over at his house
while only a few of us actually had prior experience playing it was fun and a bunch of people made the comment that they wanted to go out and buy it
it did strike me as being a little humorous when people aske me if this was just a normal dvd
not sure how you would connect the pads then
2 ffxi websites the site i am designing for my ffxi clan finally went online on its new paid hosting and i have also been recruited as the lead person for the ffxi division of another website
not exactly what i would call the best timing to have both of these come up together but itll at least keep me busy for a while
3 extremely good movies i saw 3 movies this week i robot the bourne supremacy and catwoman
i liked all of these movies a whole lot and definitely recommend that anyone reading this should go see them
i robot was a very entertaining cdifimystery movie the bourne supremacy was an extremely good sequel although i suggest seeing the bourne identity first and catwoman rivals spiderman 2 as being one of the best superheroine movies ive ever seen
going along with the number 3 thats how many people called my house within 45 minutes wanting an answer to the exact same question
not a whole lot of crosscommunication going on there
yesterday marked the one month point until we have to go back to school august 16th
every summer i always say that im going to do a whole lot of stuff but as expected i maybe get about 110 of it done
still in the middle of reading my two books for summer reading which hopefully i can get finished up by the week prior to school starting so i have a few days to review each of them
anyone that knows me knows that reading comprehension isnt exactly an area where i excel in
style analysis and what the deeper meaning of lines 523 are no
nbsp for the past 4 nights tuesdayfriday weve had vacation bible school at our church
since my grandparents are the ministers i of course get to help with everything that we do food singing crafts etc
at least thats over with and i hold the unofficial veto power for any and all future years
nbsp ratchet and clank the first one not going commando is my new favorite game
im about 23 to 34 done with it already and next up on my list is the sequel
im trying to play and beatnbspgames that have sequels or simply more games coming out in the series coming out this fall rampc up your arsenal sly 2 band of thieves jak 3 etc
before the sequels come out
then not to mention great games such as beyond good and evil metal arms glitch in the system and prince of persia that i still need to play
i wonder if 1 month if even enough
sam wanted me to make sure that i mentioned that he and stephaine holford were over at my house on tuesday
sam and i were supposed to be working on the computer science club websitenbsp but all we really did was play ddr for about 12 hours
so sam and stephanie heres your shout out that you wanted on my blognbsp
hope that anyone who bothers to read this had a great 4th of july weekend and did lots of fun stuff
we didnt go anywhere like we normally do since tonight we are going to see the second musical that we have tickets to the king and i
since saturday evening i have been downloading episodes from two of my favorite comedies on fox
the first one quintuplets just premiered a few weeks ago but has already become one of the shows that i try to watch every week
the other show arrested development has completed its first season and is going to start its second in the fall
both of these shows are part of foxs lol sunday lineup so it makes them easy to watch along with malcolm
the past two days have been pretty boring for me
next week is a completely different story though
if youre going to read this post however you get a run down of the boring past two days not the exciting future week
almost gained an entire level really 2 but i had so little xp left to go for the first one that im not counting it by fighting in batallia downs
kazham needs to go die and take all of its evil gobs with it
also started the first splinter cell on xbox again i have this habit of restarting games that im not all that far in if i havent played them in ages last night but im still on the first level
so much for trying to diminish my backlog of games this summer
today was a little more active but not by much
i went out to lunch at cicis pizza and then came home and started playing swg
not really sure how ive done comparatively in swg today to ffxi yesterday but ive still made progress
i also explained to my parents about upgrading their cellphones to gsm im the only one with that right now but i still need to get them to go to cingular and actually do the upgrade
since there were no big movies that came out today that i wanted to see although i probably will rent collateral when it comes out on dvd the movie that made todays cut was the manchurian candidate
well the reviews were definitely right on this one it was an extremely good movie and a welcome change from last week
if youve seen the original i havent it supposedly changes quite a bit of stuff up such as who is running for office etc
no complaints from me though and its definitely one of my recommended movies of the summer
two words or rather a word and a number doom
yeah thats probably the best word to describe it
even though i dont have the most powerful computer in the world p4 2
0 768 ram geforce 4 ti 4600 128 mb video card this game still looks incredible
and even though its not going to scare the living daylights out of you every 3 seconds well it might at harder difficulty levels im playing on the easiest setting and only at the very beginning of the 4th mission this is a much better source for being scared than that pathetic excuse for a movie in general called the village
mummy daddy wake up were going to the beach today remember jonah shook his parents by their shoulders
daddy stirred from his sleep and leaned over to the side table to reach for the clock
its too early daddy replied groggily
but daddy i want to see the sunrise jonah whined
he continued to shake his mummy
jonah whats wrong darling mummy asked him sleepily with one eye opened
i want to go to the beach now mummy
i want to catch the sunrise
jonah urged mummy to wake up
wait downstairs and let mummy and daddy change before we stroll through the beach mummy replied as she pushed daddy off the bed and signaled him to bathe
jonah excitedly got off the bed and ran downstairs
he had always loved the sunrise and today he had wanted to catch the sun rising across the waters
though the drive from his house to the beach was short he still wanted them to arrive slightly earlier
he waited as patiently as he could and got out the cereal box to eat his breakfast calmly
just as he was about to finish he heard his parents coming down the stairs
like a bolt of lightning he went to his parents and pulled them to the front door
jonah we havent even have our breakfast mummy scolded him gently
well have our breakfast later daddy replied laughingly
so the trio went out of the door and went to their driveway
it was still dark but jonah was used to the darkness so were his parents
jonah climbed on the seat quickly and rushed his parents to move faster
seconds later they were driving through the lane which led to the beach
when they reached jonah left his parents side and straightaway climbed on a large rock facing the sea
he huddled himself together and felt the morning breeze blowing gently across his face
he checked his watch and realized that after all the commotion it was only 5
he turned his head when daddy called him
jonah your mum and i will be getting our breakfast
you wait here alright well get you your breakfast too
nodding his head he turned back to watch the sea
he was used to being left alone on the beach to catch sunrise while his parents went away
they had taught him to be independent though he was only eleven
he smelled the crisp air of oklahoma and felt free
he loved the beach so much that his parents actually bought the house so that he could frequent the beach
when a tinge of orange crept into the darkness jonah kept his eyes on it
slowly as if playing hideandseek the glowing sun peeped from behind the sea
the warmth of the sun spread through the beach and pierced through the cold morning breeze engulfing jonah with its warmth
jonah breathed in a fresh of fresh air and pampered himself with the feeling of being engulfed
he saw a few other people strolling together mostly couples hand in hand
laying his head on his arm he waited for his parents to come with his breakfast and they will be able to stroll the beach together
but they never came back
jonah waited and waited but there was no sign of them
it was his uncle who came to pick him up
jonah come here son his uncles voice rang out and he felt two hands taking his shoulder
he was then embraced by his uncle
he was puzzled as to why his uncle came instead of his parents and why there were tears in his uncles eyes
he was also bewildered as to why his uncle was hugging him tightly
what happened jonah still remembered how curious he felt to see his relatives crying
never have he seen his uncles cry though he had seen his aunties cry
his uncle johnny led him into a room and he saw two beds occupied but the person on each bed were covered with blanket all the way over their heads
jonah became puzzled as to why uncle johnny showed them to him
he was not afraid of ghost or anything
was this another prank but when uncle johnny brought him closer to the beds he felt his hair stand and his heart felt heavy
what is going on uncle john jonah asked curiously as he looked up to look at uncle john
uncle john only stifled a cry before lifting the covers
he felt the ground swayed when he saw his daddy and mummy paleface lying on each bed
why are you sleeping jonah asked furiously
he refused to believe or even think that his parents were not coming back
wake up you promised to buy me breakfast remember jonah all but shouted
wake up please mummy daddy
please dont leave me all alone jonah finally cried as he hugged his parents lifeless body
please dont leave me all alone here
i dont want to be alone
15 years had passed since his parents died but at 26 now he could still remember the tragedy like as if it was yesterday
his parents were killed at a car crashed
they crashed with a drunkard who was driving in a drunken stupor
life had been hard after that
he still remembered asking for his parents sometimes when he had nightmares at night
but it was always his uncle john who stood by him
it was also thanks to him that he received proper education and lifestyle
he really owned that old man a lot
now that he was a successful shop ownerselling books he moved out of uncle johns apartment and bought one of his own
occasionally he would visit uncle john like today
uncle john where are you jonah called out when he was at the porch
jonah here backyard young man uncle john shouted
knowingly jonah went to the backyard and saw the dear old man standing under the redbud tree where mistletoes grew from
his uncle john loves to plant plants
atleast that will keep his mind off about getting me married jonah thought to himself
jonah hurried to uncle john and pecked his cheek
glad that oyu could come jonah
i was getting bored being here alone
though there is company just next door
a new neighbour sexy as hell jonah
shaking his head jonah sat down under the tree with uncle john
so how have you been jonah uncle john asked getting serious
jonah could only shrug his shoulders
he couldnt tell uncle john that he still had nightmares
he decided that it was best to keep quiet
the two kept quiet as they gaze across the lawn
due to the weekly companion by jonah he was also able to help mow the lawn
the silence was shattered by the slam of the door
it came from the new neighbour and seconds later a figure hurried towards them
john you ok i called your home but no one picked it up
so this is the sexy neighbour unce john was talking about
jonah gazed at her up and down
she was wearing long pants and long sleeve shirt but still he couldnbspimagine that she has got a great body underneathe
nbsphe was instantly attracted to her
the thought of it got him worked up
no wonder old uncle john gets worked up easily
dana meet jonah my nephew
jonah only offered a quick smile before dropping his gaze
in that brief moment he could see that her eyes were a light shade of green
her bronze hair cascaded past her shoulders and her body was petite but it curved at the right places
in short she was beautiful
he looked up at the mistletoes before looking down at his feet again
the man called jonah was what she thought as rude
but she did not take it into consideration much as she has a soft spot for the mans uncle
well since youre okay id better go then
see you around john dana said before retreating back to her home
what da hell was that for jonah couldnt you be more friendly uncle john repriminded him
he didnt know what was wrong with him
normally he would have be friendly with any lady that chatted up with him or he encountered but with that lady dana beautiful name his social entiquette just fail him
that lady sure has got some sort of magnetic pull in her
what if she never comes back after that encounter ill be bored to death when youre not here uncle john complained exaggeratedly as he got up to go back to his house it was getting dark
ill make sure she comes back
casting another look at danas house he slowly trudged back into the house
i come home from work
a little tired but very anxious to see my baby nura
i open the front door and silently walk in
i find the house very clean
all except for a lone sock lying in the living room floor
i confused walk over and pick it up and find that there is another at the foot of the hall
i go pick it up and find a pair of your jeans and a dark red lacy shirt lying in front of our bedroom door
i slowly and quietly open our door
i find you wearing nothing but a black pair of panties and matching bra
you look slowly and sultry up at me as you slide your hand out of your panties
you bring your wet fingers up to your mouth and lick them clean before looking deeply into my eyes and saying i was just getting warmed up for you baby
you smile at me and i smile back
as i walk towards you your back arches slightly and you spread your legs for me to slide between
i crawl slowly onto the bed and up between your legs
and i feel your warmth on my body as you wrap your legs around me
i lower myself to kiss you softly on the lips
kissing again feeling your tongue passionately mingle with mine
i feel my ahem getting harder through my pants and on your panties
you squirm excitedely under me as you feel it too
we kiss deeper and harder as you we slowly and softly grind together
i fumble with your bra as we kiss ever more passionately
finally your bra slides off of you
i softly kiss your nipples and lick all around your breasts
feeling them getting harder in my mouth
your hands are at my waist unbuttoning my pants and slide them down slightly
you take my pants down some and i slide them completely off
i also take my shirt off so that i can feel your soft skin against mine
we kiss passionately and i run my fingers down your sexy body
i love the feel of my hands on you
i ask you if i can take your panties off
and without a word you take my hands and slide them to the elastic of your panties and help me slide them off
are you sure bout this
but before i can get the words out you have already pulled me towards you
so warm inside as i slide slowly into your hot wet pussy hope word is okay
your so tight and as i get deeper and deeper inside of you you gasp and your eyes close slowly
i pull out of you slowly and slide in gently loving the feeling as i slide deeper and deeper into you
feeling your tight pussy sliding around my um
dripping wet and so very warm
you begin to rock with me and i hear you moaning my name softly as i slide in and out of you
i lean down and kiss and lick your nipples as i slide in and out of you
i begin to kiss you deeply catching the moans before they leave your mouth
the room is getting hotter and hotter and as it does a little sweat drips off of our bodies
the sweat runs all over our whole bodies as we are one
making it easier to slide deeper and deeper inside of you
as i get a little harder you moan with slight pain but intense joy
i ask if you want me to stop but you say loudly no deeper briiiiaaaannn
i slide deeper and deeper inside of you
leave my lips almost involuntarily
you arch your back as you moan even louder as your sweet juices run down onto our white sheets
you pull yourself harder against me as i grow larger inside of you and slide even deeper into your hot pussy
your moans turn into screams of joy mmmmm brian more brian
mmmm brrrriiiaaannnnnnn at this time i feel you release me
and i feel your hot juices explode inside of you
as you cum i feel a strange surge of energy and sensitivity slide through my body as i cum deeply inside of you
our hot bodies lying side by side
i hold you tight i love you nura radfordharrison
with a gasp you say i love you too
and we pull each other close
i lay your head on my chest as you fall asleep in my arms
this is when i know that im the luckiest guy in the world
so happy to have you by my side
as you probably know i am in virginia beach at my grandparents house
anyway we are driving back to ohio tomorrow and were leaving at 8 in the morning
as it is about 1011 hrs i wont be able to post the hitter update in time for all of the games so you will have to do without me
this probably means you now have no chance whatsoever but thats life i guess
i might talk about the 705 and later games if i get home in time probably not
have a good one regardless
happy friday there were a lot of pretty good performances last night by pitchers only one that i would call a great one so we will lead off w that one
here it goes yesterdays best z
day mtl 9 ip w 0 er 6 h 0 bb 4 k against the royals
day has been doing well this year despite a 56 record he has an era of 3
if he gets some more run support either through offense or a trade he could win 15 a season
he is a very good young pitcher
zambrano chc 8 ip w 2 er 5 h 4 bb 7 k
he is a top 5 pitcher so far this season imo schmidt r johnson a
his curveball has a lot more on it this year than what i have seen before
he is able to depend on that pitch as well and i think that he has potential to maintain this all season
fossum ari 6 ip w 0 er 5 h 2 bb 5 k over bal
his counterpart bautista for baltimore had a perfect game thru 5 or 6 i think but gave up a 3 run shot the next inning
this was definitely an aberration he got his era below 6 so i wouldnt look for another similar performance any time soon
2 ip w 1 er 4 h 1 bb 7 k
another pitcher quietly having a good season
while beckett and burnett are struggling pavano has been the marlins rock in the rotation
2nd straight very good start 64 7
2 ip w 1 er and 62 3
he might be peaking right now so i dont know if i would hold on to him for the rest of the season
ishii la 8 ip w 1 er 6 h 1 bb 4 k
also having a good season 83 3
he is getting a bit more run support than last year not by much but more nonetheless
he has shown improvement each of the last 3 yrs especially w his control
schilling bos 7 ip w 2 er 6 h 2 bb 8 k
always good for a solid performance schilling has had a consistent season
for his price you could probably get a marginally better pitcher but he is not going to let you down very often
if you have the money he is a smart pickup
those were the best performances of last night
some pitchers to look for good things from tonight are livan hernandez mtl plays at seattle tonight who has been a struggling offensive team
hernandez is known as an inningeater so i will predict 7
2 ip 2 er 5 h and a win why not go for it all w my predictions tim hudson oak a safe enough pick playing at home v
pit whose offense had been struggling although they scored 7 yesterday
i will say 7 ip 3 er 7 h and a win for tim
i think the as can match however many runs the pirates throw up there
al leiter nym has an era this season below 2 1
playing against kc only enhances my confidence in him
i kind of want to say cg shutout but leiter probably doesnt have that much endurance in him
7 ip 1 er 2 h win
brett myers phi plays at min home of the evil ventilation system
he will overcome this hardship and get a win in 6
he will give up 3 er and 6 h
i know this to be a fact not really
had you fooled there scott schoeneweis chisox my out on a limb pick for the night he had a great rookie year 3ish yrs ago along w rick ankiel and has done well this season as well
performance of the night v
atlcg 3hitter 1 unearned run 2 bb 9 k win
there you have it who says i dont have the balls to predict stuff hope this is helpful and accurate
if you find any errors you will get mentioned in my next post and maybe you will win a new car any comments regarding format and or content are always welcome
good luck and have a good one
here is my 1st hitter update for yesterdays games
just one correction from yesterdays pitcher update the milana game went 17 not 15 innings
ty to captainfurby for bringing that to my attention
on w the hitter update
renteria stl 14 gs hr 2 r 4 bi 1 bb
decent numbers on the yr only 4 hr
this seems to have been an anomaly
he is probably the best ss in the nl but the al has much better options c
guillen det 34 hr 2 r 1 bi sb
quietly having a very good year for the relatively speaking rejuvenated tigers
326 on the yr w 5 3b 9 hr 15 2b
he strikes out a bit too much but that has always been his case
easily his best yr as a pro m
tejada bal 24 hr 3 bi 1 r 1 bb 1 k
broke out of a bit of a slump 214 2 bi since 63 in a big way
has had a consistent yr for the os batting
he has established himself as one of the top ss in the league
abreu phi 24 2 hr 3 r 3 bi 1 bb 1 k
has had incredible last 5 games 818 9 r 7 bi 6 bb 3 k 2 sb 3 hr 2 2b
299 w 14 hr on season he has been very solid for the majority of the season
i would pick him up now if you still can
aaron rowand chisox 35 hr 2b 2 r 3 bi 1 k
he has been the teams 4th of all season but w maggs out for an expected 47 weeks it is his chance to shine
he got off to a great start yesterday
if you are looking for a cheap player who will start look no further
miller oak 24 gs hr 4 bi 2 r 1 k
on a 3game tear 613 2 hr 12 biyes 12 4 r 4 2b
he has not been especially good all year and imo is somewhat overpriced
however if he can keep this up that will no longer be the case
this recent tear may have some correlation to reds pitching however
wait a game or 2 this could be a fluke
other players that had notable games last night include k
dye oak another very hot player and a
dunn cin see last parenthetical statement
there are some obscure players i have adopted as my favorites that i will update you on periodically
youkilis bos mentioned profusely in moneyball by michael lewis a fascinating book if youre into these things his nickname is the greek god of walks
he has had a productive rookie season and last night was 13 with a walk
400 look for great things next year and maybe even late this season from him so taguchi stl 14 3b 1 bb 2 r last night
he is also a rookie this yr and is used primarily as a ph or pr
258 on the season he also has a 1
he has shown improvement lately and i think that he could start in a year or 2
i follow him bc i like his name
its going to be the new phrase in stl soon
people will be like that was so taguchi meaning that was so clutch
mark these words he will be big baby thats it for the hitter wrapup today
some games that should have good hitting numbers today are col j
the last one is just bc the last 2 games in the series have been 1311 and 1410 not bc of poor pitching
any comments you have are welcome
last night saw quite a few outstanding performances by pitchers
i will go over a few of them as well as give my thoughts on some pitching matchups today
my family drove to my grandparents house in virginia beach last night and today so i will be there for the week
the 11hour drive wears on you a bit but i am recovering now
so here you are last night ben sheets mil he turned in the performance of the night and left w a nd
9 innings of 1hit scoreless ball but the game went to 15 i believe
no walks and 5 k as well
he seems to have fully recovered from the dizziness that made him miss his last start pedro martinez bos a great outing in an inconsistent year he got a w for 8 innings of scoreless 2hit pitching
walked 2 and 8 ks as well
this is in stark contrast to last outing where he gave up 7 er and 11 hits in 5 ip
i am of the opinion that his ship has been righted for this season yes i am reversing field from yesterday i can do that zack greinke kc got the win after 7 innings of scoreless 3hit ball w 5 k and no walks
the expos didnt hurt his stats he has quietly put together a solid year
he is 11 in 4 starts w an era of 1
73 over 26 innings 6
a good option for al only leagues or if youre low on
31 kbb ratio looks pretty good also
kelvim escobar tor if you want to talk about hot heres your man
last 2 outings he has been 10 with 1 er over 16 innings
last night he got a nd after 8 innings of scoreless 4hit ball including 11 k
42 on the season 3
34 era and 5420 kbb another good alonly pickup
he seems to be settling in as a starter after being a reliever 2 yrs ago
randy johnson ari big unit rebounded from an average performance last outing notching a w on 1 run 3 hits in 7 ip
only 4 k but he has been 50 beginning w the perfect game
75 on the season and is averaging nearly 7 ip per start
other notable performances came from roger clemens 0 er 3 h 6
2 ip 6 bb 7 k w javier vazquez 1 er 5 h 7 ip 0 bb 6 k w matt clement 3 er 5 h 8 ip 1 bb 9 k w as well as jerome williams and ted lilly
todays games since i just now have gotten access to a computer i already know what happened to mark prior today
after a solid 1st outing he struggled against st louis
2 innings and gave up 5 er on 5 hits and 5 bb
he threw 83 pitches 49 for strikes
edgar renteria hit a gs in the 4th to knock him out
as i said yesterday i would give him another start or 2 to make sure he has recovered i have to emphasize it when i get something right
other pitchers to look for today would be b
lawrence sd although he is pitching against a solid boston lineup the padres have given him plenty of run support
last start was solid 1 er 5 h 7
1 ip and i would look for a performance slightly below that today this is definitely a limb i am going out on but he doesnt usually walk many k
brown nyy he has been concerned w hes control lately but his walk numbers are very low 17 bb in 78
his last start was mediocre but he is 71 on the season
i would look for another 7 ip 3 er and a win from him
schmidt sf after 2 opening losses 70 with a 1hitter
last 2 starts have been 20 with 14 ip 3 er 7 h 20 k and 5 bb
pitching at tb shouldnt bring him any problems
this is as close to a lock as you can get i would think
milton phi another relative unknown i am fond of
last 2 starts he is 20 w 14 ip 2 er 8 h 8 k and 5 bb
the white sox offense has been solid this yr but maggs is out so milton should have a good start and i believe he should get a w
that is your wednesday pitcher update
tomorrow we will cover hitters
feel free to post any feedback whatsoever
i hope you can find this helpful and enjoyable
this post is my take on who is hot and who is cooling off based on performance over the last week or so
in the fantasy game i play players prices fluctuate pretty closely with their performance however some do not eg roger clemens plummeting sp price
this is therefore not a barometer of who will make more just who has been playing above or below what they have done this season
that said here are my picks and their stats last week hot hitters j
estrada c atlanta 817 4 runs 4 rbi 4 2b 1 hr 4 bb 2k injured lineup not hurting estrada he has had a career season s
casey 1b cincinnati 622 4 runs 3 rbi 1 2b 2 hr 3k nl avg

griffey of cincinnati 819 8 runs 5 rbi 4 hr 6 bb 3 k see jd drew j
dye of oakland 725 6 runs 6 rbi 3 hr 3 bb 7 k 1 sb trying to prove that hot hot start was no fluke pitchers c

1 ip w 6 k 9 h 3er 71 3
42 on the season next start 612 at texas
cards have had good run support all season
low era and walk ratios too many hits may come back to haunt him though
danny graves rp cin blown save 65 cant discount 26 saves already
27 era for a closer is a bit frightening
he has 3 games v
cle this week and should be good for a save or 2 in that series e
milton sp phi 530 7 ip w 8 k 3 bb 1 er 3 h 64 7 ip w 5 k 2 bb 1 er 5 h 71 3
78 season next start 69 at chisox
only drawback is that he only averages about 5
prior sp chc 64 6 ip nd 8 k 2 h 0 er 1st game back from rehab was stellar wait until 69 start v
stl to see if hes back for good
cordero rp tex 20 18 s 1
pit coming up then 3 v
he is ready for a breakthrough imo
benitez rp fla 10 22 s
has been the best rp in baseball this season
very consistent gives up very few walks and er
should be good for 50 saves this year
cooling off hitters pittsburgh in general 28 last 10 games mackowiak ward and jack wilson went a combined 1581 last week and 3 games v
oak this week dont look promising either
burrell phi 43 rbi on the season only 1 in the last week as he went 320 with 1 run and 5 k
overbay 1b mil avg is ok 616 but earlier power numbers are way down 1 rbi 0 hr last week
ana and hou w their pitching is not promising
guerrero of ana 3 games does not make a slump but beware
after his 9 rbi game he has gone 012 w 3 k in last 3 games
i would still hold on to him for now but keep an eye out
pierre of fla now has 10 cs on the yr 3 last wk
has also dipped about 15 pts last wk
moved to 2nd in order has not helped him produce so far
kennedy sp col 43 3
64 season last game only 3 ip before knocked out
the hot start is over
dump him while you can
next start is 69 v
martinez sp bos 62 nd 5 ip 4 k 2 bb 11 h 7 er lucky not to get a loss last game
has been very inconsistent all year
maybe if he got a deal signed
beckett fla 15 day 531 blister r
halladay tor 15 day 64 retroactive 528 shoulder j
peavy sd 15 day 527 r
520 forearm sleeper kevin youkilis 3b bos the star of moneyball by michael lewis is having a consistent rookie season
over the last week he is 420 w 2 runs 4 rbi 1 2b 1 hr 2 bb 4 k
i wouldnt take him now unless i was nearly out of money but i will update you on him periodically
this ends the first weekly wrapup
please comment on anything you disagree with or feel i omitted
also feel free to comment on the general feedback
as few people are reading this right now you have a chance to shape this site significantly for the future
also since few people read this i have no choice but to listen to you so send whatever you want and tell everybody you know about this
hope you enjoy and find this helpful
i took the joke thing off so you can no longer be offended
for all of you millions of people who are already fastidiously reading everything i write and have waited all night for a new post here you go
i have decided to dedicate the bulk of this site to analyzing fantasy baseball
when the season is over i will probably shift the focus to something else maybe politics or something
regardless i hope to dedicate sundays wednesdays and fridays to pitchers thursdays saturdays and mondays to hitters and tuesday to a weekly wrapup it fits my schedule
today is tuesday so you get a weekly wrapup i guess
that will be my next post
this is a disclaimer on the jokes on the bottom right
i just signed up for the service
i realize some are kind of tasteless but the majority are good enough
sorry if you are offended
sorry about that last link it definitely does not work
even if you are logged in to smallworld
com where this link will take you it will only tell you your team center not mine
so i will encourage you to make your own fantasy baseball team anyway it is free
if you read this and want to join a league there is a league you can join
the league is called mrowo and the password is facejr i did not make this up
com and join basic fantasy baseball season 1
the season is over halfway over so you probably cant catch up but it is still fun and you can do season 2 after allstar game
my team is tickle me hinrich
if you have trouble email me at zmattybyahoo
here is a link to see my fantasy baseball scores every day
im not sure if these will work or not and i think you have to be a member of smallworld
com sporting news fantasy games for it to work
that probably narrows down the field quite a bit actually now that i think about it
regardless i will post this anyway and hope it works
whats up my name is matthew and i live in columbus oh
i am going to be a senior in high school next year
i play golf and soccer and i work as a caddy at scioto country club
i love all sports and follow them pretty closely
i also love fantasy sports especially baseball
i will try to get some links up so you can check out other stuff about me once i figure this out
sorry that i have not been updating this site very faithfully lately
if i do this i have to do it in the morning and i am either golfing caddying or sleeping pretty much every morning
so i am afraid this is not going to be a daily update thing unless somebody can think of a more effective format eg not talking about the results from last nights games
if anybody has any good ideas regarding the future of this page they are more than welcome actually they dont even have to be good
i can figure something out but your input helps
sorry im a day late i know
nbsp i was out late last night if i posted when i got home it would have been monday anyway
nbsp this weeks top 5 is vegetables for inspiration read my other blog
nbsp actually it is vegitables
nbsp anyway here we go 5
rudabega as mentioned before i do these in reverse order so this is the last one and i am out of ideas
nbsp i have never had this the word just sounds cool
nbsp its my list i can do what i want with it
peas cooked only the pods taste weird
nbsp like corn you can mix them with a lot of foods and they taste good
carrots only in carrot stick form though
nbsp i dip them in butter when no one is looking
nbsp cooked carrots lose the texture which is the main attraction for me
nbsp 20 million bunny rabbits cant be wrong 2
broccoli i developed an attachment to this at a young age when everyone else hated it and i didnt
nbsp only good cooked however as i was traumatized when i saw wormy type things in uncooked broccoli once still makes me ick right now i am paranoidically scratching my head
nbsp very good with melted cheese 1
cornoff the cob i can mix this vegitable with the rest of the food on my plate and it will taste good
nbsp on the cob it is just soooo fun to eat
i dont know why i ever leave the house except to buy it
it is good with butter and a slight peppering so there are my top 5 vegitables
nbsp if you think this is a dumb topic im headoflettuce43 and give him a piece of your mind
nbsp otherwise feel free to chime in with your sentimental vegitable stories
nbsp until next sundayish time period this has been your top 5
nbsp actually it will be after that period too
wow i almost forgot about this
nbsp hmm this list will be spontaneous
nbsp this kind of sucks but its all i can come up with at this time
nbsp this weeks top 5 category is nbsp places i would most like to live postcollege nbsp 5
i do these in reverse order so this is tough
ha heres an interesting one
nbsp i think it would be interesting to see how different life is over there
nbsp that is the one foreign country i would most like to visit and my friend said the ladies enjoy american accents
i would definitely have to visit there before i decided to live there though
boston i am running out of ideas but i liked the city
nbsp this would probably mean that i ended up going to mit or harvard which is fine although im not too big on harvard
nbsp i enjoy snownbspand cold so i would be at home there
nbsp the negatives are that the natives dont seem particularly friendly and nobody cares about college football there ooh boston college
ha i guess 1 has a similar dilemma though
boston is a nice enough city nbsp 3
columbus oh although its kind of boring there are much worse
nbsp i am quite used to it and its a pretty affordable place to live
nbsp then you have the buckeyes and the central location of the vaunted buckeye nation it seems like every other car has a bumper sticker or vanity plate or flag for osu
nbsp i would like to have some space from my family though
chicago i almost liked this as much as 1 see that shortly but i didnt get to see much of it so im not positive
nbsp the area on lake shore drive was gorgeous though
nbsp plus a great sports town always a plus nbsp 1
nyc manhattan preferably i went there this spring break and my visit only made me more enamored of the city than what i had been before
nbsp in addition to being the financial capital of the world which is kind of my desired career area right now yes its not terribly exciting but i find it interesting its like the citys generators could cut out and the city would still run bc there is so much energy there if that makes sense
nbsp it was awesome and i would love to live there although not cheap i would guess
nbsp sidenote i was there the day before the nit final which michigan was in
nbsp when i was walking around times sq i saw 3 tall guys in michigan warmups so im guessing they were on the basketball team
nbsp i wanted to get a pic of the 4 of us holding up our arms like ohio but i kind of wussed out
nbsp but i did see them i think one was courtney sims very good soph centerforwardnot sure
nbsp so you can see famousish people there too nbsp as you can probably see i would like to live in a big city
nbsp i just find small towns kind of depressing bc there seems to be no variety in the life there
nbsp it strikes me as a lack of progress which is something that scares me in any form
nbsp i know that every place has its own advantages and i have nothing against small towns they just dont seem to be for me watch as i end up living in one for the rest of my life
nbsp to each his or her for those that are politically correctly inclined own right
04 yes this is edition 2 of the weekly top 5
this is a big step towards consistency as i have not yet forgotten about this
about 2 more of these and i would think that this will have been solidified as a definite department of the blog
without much further ado this weeks top 5 is things i heard the most at camp 5 hows it going hoppy according to camp lore hoppy is some guy from 100 years ago who was made fun of bc he had a curved spine and a short leg
to make a long story short he was found dead in a cave frozen to death while clutching a fawn to keep it warm
since i was kind of hopping around w crutches this nickname was bestowed upon me and it spread quite quickly
it could be worse i guess
4 hows the ankle pretty selfexplanatory
as you hear this question more and more you kind of get a default answer without many details once you realize that they dont want to know that badly
3 i have to pee to be expected w 3rd grade guys
we had a buddy system which grew much more relaxed as the week progressed
my response went from get your buddy to just go in the woods or something
peeing in the woods is part of the camp experience right 2 my insert authority figure usually male such as dadgrandpa can insert impressive feat that is usually doubled in exaggeration as covered yesterday these kids still idolize their parentswhoever else
some of these stories were obviously fabricated some were probably true
another fun thing that came up a lot about parents was personal information such as dietsweightage of parents
these parents might want to rethink telling the kids this stuff
1 what did you do to your anklehow did you manage that imagine telling about 100 people literally that your injury was from something as dumb as jumping off of a slide from 1 foot off the ground
i would have liked my injury to have been from something a bit more respectable maybe i dived into the pool to save a kid from drowning or something like that
humility is a good thing
i am off to watch some us olympic trials for track field now then a 2hour special on trading spaces yes i am quite serious i happen to enjoy that show and no this does not mean i am gay some of the designers on the other hand
04 i have just had a revolutionary concept
every sunday i will give you my opinion on my personal top 5 somethings
this is very tentative and it is more than possible that this will be the only one
with that in mind the first category is
music albums these are all from the last 7 or so years so there was never really consideration for any classic albums
as you can see most of these albums are from my favorite bands which is no coincidence
without further ado here are my top 5
a rush of blood to the head coldplay i got this cd last year and i listened to it on my way to every golf match
its very calming and i love every track from 17
just be tiesto this is that new to me at least trance album i have been raving about
the best song on it is by far the 1st track forever today which is probably in the top 5 songs hint hint for me
who says the london club scene is weak i think he is the 1 dj in the world
emajn cloud2ground another incredible technotrance album
this is what got me addicted to the tranceindie thing
the best 2 tracks are 1 raindown and 6 face2face which is the most beautiful song i have heard other than amazing grace on bagpipes and possibly lee greenwoods god bless the usa anyway its an awesome album except i dont really like the last 2 tracks
the 1st 7 are incredible 2
the anatomy of the tongue in cheek relient k this is the most diverse album up here
they always have a couple of goofy songs on their album the difference here is that those songs are really sweet im liono may the horse be with you
i also love the raw emotion in these words are not enough and for moments when i feel faint and down in flames and failure to excommunicate are awesome as well
the fact that this is not their most recent album yet it makes up about half their concert set says something about the strength of this album
ok computer radiohead how do i love thee
let me count the ways
about 9 as in 9 of the best songs ever actually track 7 doesnt really count but its funny anyway
35 kind of suck but it seems that every compilation cd i make has at least 3 songs from this album
the guitar solo in paranoid android is one of the best of the posthendrix era imo and electioneering is still my favorite songs even though it is about 7 years old
karma police airbag and climb up the walls the song that made me get
this cd in the 1st place
kid a and their newest one arent as good as this but radiohead is still a remarkable band
edition 1 of my top 5
if anyone has differing opinions there should be no differing with this list feel more than free to post a comment i would love to hear from you yes you
this weeks edition on time might i add is inspired by last weeks espnusa today coaches poll for college football
it is top 5 most overrated teams not named ohio state in the top 25
clemson 16a hot pick bc of a qb and a win over fsu last yr
and a coachs last name bowden
very difficult schedule and i dont think they are very good on d either way
projection 75 outside top 25 on record projections im not sure exactly how many games each team will play which could make some records impossible
im just lazy i guess
k state 13without roberson teams can stack the box easily and at least slow sproles down
not a very tough schedule they might end up top 10 but i still wont think theyre that good
miami 5sorry to knock on them so much here
they lost a lot of talent and they play a real schedule this yr
virginia 19overrated last yr only difference is that they lost a qb schaub hmm
sounds like a top 25 team
only thing they have is solid lb play
projection 75 outside top 25 1
auburn 18remember last years sleeper team the one that slept pretty soundly offensively vs
usc in opener 230 i believe they came on in the middle of the season but i dont think theyre anything special
projection 85 outside top 25 i could obviously be completely wrong on all of these its mainly just my gut
at least i had the balls to pick them
we shall see what happens
i cannot wait for college football season
just got back from driving my neighbor back from the airport i run a taxi company in my spare time
there was a bad accident on 270 east just west of 71
there was a semi overturned on the side and there was a pickup w a boat on back in the road w its front end completely smashed
they had to block off 2 or 3 lanes of 270 which just left 3 open
i think i cut about 5 or 6 people off to get through all of the traffic but i had to get to the airport in time i ended up having about 15 minutes to spare
so im kind of wondering if everybody involved is ok or not
there were a bunch of cops plus a crane there but i didnt see an ambulance which either means it had already come or nobody was hurt
i can probably update you on this tomorrow
it was kind of sobering to see after i was getting very frustrated with traffic before i knew what happened
i guess tomorrow is never guaranteed
now im getting philosophical here
there now im over it
im going to go watch last comic standing now
that show is kind of dumb but i am somewhat addicted what else are you going to do on a tuesday night other than sit at home and watch tv
i just got finished cleaning my bathroom it was the first time i ever did the whole thing by myself
i scrubbed the toilet and bathtub and the counter and then i mopped the floor
now i am kind of sticky
nonetheless i am quite proud of myself
today i decided to stay home to do stuff around the house
i am being forced to make a filing system for the whole college application thing so i spent a couple of hours this morning setting that up
after that i cut the grass which is when i found out that it is really quite a nice day out
this afternoon i will probably go play with my neighbors cat as a job not just because i have nothing better to do then go hit balls at the range
i got my sat ii subject test scores back in the mail
i got 800 on math iic 740 chemistry and 740 writing
i was quite shocked especially about the chemistry which i thought i got about 550 on and especially since i was almost dead the day i took it sick i slept the entire day after i got back
very very sick not to mention miserable
my theory is that in every test room there is a sick kid who is sniffling and coughing constantly
i just happened to be that person that day
the thing that surprised me is that the 800 perfect score is only the 90 percentile which means 10 of the people get a perfect
i guess its not that incredibly hard or something
anyway i am just excited about that whole thing
not sure how to make excited smiley he is smiling a lot though as you can see
yes this means that i am back home again
actually we got back saturday night but i have been pretty busy
the only other times i have been to chicago twice were just connector flights through ohare so this was the first time i had seen the city
we stayed downtown so we walked around the lake shore park area which was beautiful
unfortunately the traffic was terrible worse than nyc imo i have heard that la traffic is worse
i really pity them if it is so everything like the museums and shedd aquarium was closed
the next day friday we went to visit campus
it just felt like they had the same sort of priorities that i would want they also seemed proud that theyre the only school undefeated vs
the campus was beautiful too
i think it is probably in my top 3 schools now yale william and mary plus its a little easier to get into
i was surprised at how seriously chicago took its baseball
the city series cubssox was starting up the day we left so that probably contributed but the obsession was nearing the ohio state football level in columbus an inascertainable level the benchmark of all irrational obsessions i would say
although not a bad one by any means
i think i could live in a city like that
after the visit we drove to st louis friday night
our hotel room was upgraded to a vip suite
we were the customer of the day
not sure what that is all about but the room was cool
we ate at j bucks in clayton suburb where i realized that st louis was probably as into sports as chicago
i guess that there isnt much else in the midwest that we are so narrowminded
anyway saturday morning we visited wustl which i liked not as much as uc but it seemed to be a place i wouldnt mind going to
i think i will apply there too
we got back saturday night so i would have time to go to a meeting sunday morning for camp counselors for a camp i am helping with at my church
i get to be with 3rd grade boys for a week july 610 i think
it will be interesting to say the least
i am looking forward to it
this morning i had my first tournament of the yr
i was gangraped by mosquitoes early on so i am trying to move as little as possible now
i overcame them to an extent and i ended up shooting 89
while that sounds terrible i actually played very well i just had 3 bad holes 2 triplebogeys and a quad
if you take those away it was a decent round plus the course was tough and i hadnt played it before
i tied for 2nd in the tournament that should give you an idea of how strong the league is86 won it
the group i played in was pretty bad
on one whole we lost 8 balls as a foursome
the other kids kept having to go back and rehit from the tee
i just sat on the ground and waited then i started cracking up
kind of like the judges on american idol during auditions
i felt mean but i couldnt help it
the kids behind us were getting pretty mad which was probably the funniest part
they hit into us a couple of times
you have to find humor in these things i guess
there were scores of 12 and 10 on that hole and they both kind of cheated but i felt bad for them
in case youre wondering i lost a ball but still made bogey6 it would have been a birdie if i hadnt lost a ball so ha
i believe i am going to go see spiderman 2 wednesday night
brad picked up a bunch of tickets so hopefully everyone will be early so i dont have to sit in the aisle again see dodgeball post
i should probably rent the 1st spiderman since i still havent seen it
i think thats all i have to say
this is a pretty long post congrats if you made it all the way here the end
i am not going to be posting on this for a couple of days as i am going on a couple of college visits with the parents
we are driving grr to chicago tomorrow and visiting u chicago then to st louis to visit washington u in stl
i am looking forward to both even though i have been bombarded with mail from wustl i dont care about a postcard with alumni giving rates or percentage of graduates getting into medical school 4 times a week
somebody needs to tell them this
it actually decreases my interest
i caddied for the first time this year
got a double bag at 1240 just in time for the sun to be baking on me the entire day who would want to caddy when its not 90 degrees with no clouds or wind
this would have been a perfect day to golf
complaining aside i made 130 so it was more than worth it
my shoulder might differ with me on that
i couldnt hold the steering wheel driving back home after the loop bc my shoulder was so weak unlike the rest of my body
on a side note i saw the soup nazi episode on tbs tonight
all of my friends have told me about it and quoted it so i was expecting a lot
it was nothing special though
i guess my hopes were too high
i thought the gay thugs that stole elaines armoire from kramer were funnier
that has to be the most brilliant show ever
anyway i have an early departure time tomorrow so i should get to bed soon
i should be back by sunday
i am sick of getting up at 544 every morning even if i can get to bed by 1130 or 12 i still only get 6 hours of sleep
i cant live like this i accidentally broke my 8iron shaft on saturday so i took it in yesterday to get a new one
i didnt throw it hard or anything so im guessing it was pretty weak already
thats 25 down the drain
i went to a party last night at chales
we played crap a billiards game not the casino thing and i kept getting stuck behind cody who is really gay and kept giving me letters so i only won once
it was embarassing since i am incredible at that game

its been a while 2 whole days since the last post so this might be a bit long we shall see
yesterday i played 27 holes of golf
i sucked up the first 9 but then i came back w a 39 on the back so i went an extra 9 holes to try to break 80 an elusive goal that has consumed my golfing life since i broke 90
i started off fine but i had 2 straight 3putts and a lost ball which killed me so i ended up with 3944 83 which is my best for this season as of yet
i was happy enough but i know i blew it
that just gives me something to push for this summer i guess
last night i saw dodgeball with a bunch of friends
i got there late so we had to sit in the aisle
then some usher kicked us out bc it was a fire hazard
we got back in but we had to split up
i ended up next to some guy in the 2nd row
there were some interesting parts i will say that the pizza thing ick but it was funny for the most part
it could have been better but it fulfilled its purpose of mindless entertainment imo
we went out for sushi after that
i dont really like sushi but it was fun
this morning i played golf w my dad my pastor and another guy from church
they wouldnt play for money 666 5 nassau which is unfortunate bc i won every 6 w my partner we played for bragging rights which last time i checked wont help pay for tuition
nobody including myself played particularly well but we had a good time
after that i went to gregs grad party at the barn in westerville
its a pretty cool place i wouldnt mind having mine there
so there is my activity list of the last couple days
after the party i sat at home and watched the us open
did anybody else see the 7 green i have only played 1 green like that and it is completely unfair i 5putted it in a tournament it kept rolling backwards 20 feet
that shouldnt happen in a professional tournament
however everyone played the same unfair green so in a roundabout way it was fairish
i am pulling for phil but i dont have anything against anybody near the top
it should be fun to watch
hmm i think todays theme would be rain which causes things to become wet when exposed to it including people such as myself
i played golf today but i had to call it a round after 16 holes bc of this natural phenomenon
not too much of a loss as it was not a particularly good round
i think i was rushing things out there today
i went to the range around noon and the only part that was open were the mats no chippingputting or grass tees
i hate hitting off mats but its better than not hitting
also contributing to todays theme is the us open which is currently delayed bc of rain
not like i would be able to watch it since we dont get espn anymore
the course doesnt seem to be playing that difficile
on a side note i do believe that detroit won the nba title and for that they are offerred sp my most sincere congrats
as for the lakers there is always next yr oh wait no there isnt
hahaha they are going to get disbanded i hope
they were the closest thing this age in sports will get to a dynasty imo
its the circle of life applied to sport
if you think about it you can apply most of lifes themes to sport
its growing on you isnt it
i hate it when i prove myself wrong
the class today was so awesome
it had nothing to do with going the speed limit or not cutting people off
we did a skid car drag racing and cone maneuverability
we also did this thing where you floor it through water then slam on the brakes and control your skid so you dont run over kenny aka a bunch of cones
needless to say i killed kenny quite a few times where have i seen this before
it was still fun and i met a lot of new people john richard erica amanda feel free to comment now
it rained a lot too which made the skid car even skiddier
i guess that this was in fact not a wasted day
another bonus i drove through amish country to get there and i got to pass a real horse and buggy thing on the road i figured it was an urban legend or rural legend is more like it
boo not funny but its not
so all in all a good day
im probably going to the class party at dans tonight that might go a bit late
wow it just kind of hit me that im a senior now
another day another 85 on the links
this one i was not happy with
i was 2 thru 7 holes then i fell apart
i only hit 4 greens so i guess it could have been much worse
the heat got to me again i couldnt make 36 holes
ill probably go hit at the driving range this afternoon or something
i just remembered tomorrow my mom is making me take an allday defensive driving class
i dont need help driving since i havent had any accidents or tickets in over a year
i am viewing tomorrow as a wasted day
maybe i will end up enjoying it smirks knowingly
i slept in some this morning so i only got 18 holes in today
i think the weather could best be described as sweltering
anyway i played so much better than yesterday i shot 85 on a much harder course
i could have done better but my irons apparently all decided to go about 15 yards farther than normal today
that took me about 8 holes to figure out
i flew the green of a 155 yard par 3 with a 7iron by about 20 yards
that is a complete anomaly quite frustrating
i finally got to see day after tomorrow w cody and chad
some of the effects were a bit weak but they would be hard to do
we got our popcorn 5
i hadnt realized he worked there
if it doesnt rain too hard tonight im going to go play another 18 or 36 tomorrow depending on how early i feel like getting up
i ran out of water for about 6 holes today and i am still feeling a bit sick hence the post name
i should be able to overcome this however

i really hope the pistons can make this lead stand up
shaq is killing us this game
at least its interesting this time around
i added a different counter
guess what it doesnt work either
ack this is easily the worst thing that has ever happened to me
after church today i played 9 holes with my dad
this is only my 3rd time out this yr since i have been so busy w school and stuff
i hit the ball like complete trash
seriously i was so mad
i shot a 46 and thats only bc i made 4 15 foot putts
i have a lot of work to do this summer if i want to be worth anything on the team this fall
i just got a membership at a local club for the summer so im going to go play 36 holes tomorrow if i can
talked to dan he just got back from mexico
we might go play tomorrow if he doesnt have to work all day
im getting excited for the pistons tonight
i still hope they kill la
speaking of that i read this great article on espn
they even make fun of devean george
there is a link on here but if you dont want to read the whole thing heres the best part
six days ago most people outside of detroit thought there was no way they could contain devean and the hall of famers
now it seems impossible that the lakers will be able to stand up to the soul tide rolling through this series
what do you have to say now devean nothing thats what i thought
freaking hit counter work maybe its overloaded with all this traffic i am getting
grr i hate those white boxes with red xs
what are you going to do eh
after getting up around 7 ack the drive to ohio was only about 9 12 hrs not bad
then i got to go mow the lawn before it rains again bad
i just downloaded this awesome song by some scandinavian techno guy tiesto or something like that
i think all techno should be illegal unless its scandinavian
i spent a lot of time this week watching the reagan funeral
i dont think there is any more touching song than amazing grace
when they get to the last stanza i get chills
then during the burial ceremony they had a guy play it on bagpipes
that is even better than scandinavian technomy favorite song on my favorite instrument i guess the bagpipe is a lovehate thing i find it eerily beautiful
i find european music better than american for the most part i guess
i want bagpipes at my funeral this whole funeral thing has put me in somewhat of a reflective mood
its kind of like what will i do that people will talk about at my funeral
its a motivating thought to me
anybody with me on that during the drive i read a book called the chosen by chaim potok
it starts out like any enjoyable fiction story then it gets really deep into things like hardcore friendship and philosophy and that kind of stuff
it reminded me of another book a separate peace by john knowles
i would recommend it to anyone who considers themself introspective
so that in conjunction with the whole funeral bit has put me in a bit of a reflective morbid and rambling mood
i think i will go update my other blog and go catch some snl or something
i was at my grandparents house this week in virginia beach
it has been scorching lately but its raining right now
not a thunderstorm or anything just rain
honestly my favorite weather is a summer thunderstorm at dusk
it is so awesome to listen to
i always sleep with my window open those days
anyway we are driving back to ohio tomorrow and we are supposed to leave at 8
this is not what i had in mind for summer vacation
such is life i guess
this is my second blog
i started doing a blog of fantasy baseball update type stuff i will make a link soon in case you care so this is a more personal blog
feel free to comment or share your thoughts a form of commenting if you think about it whereever you want to
i was watching the nba finals game 3
i am sooo incredibly glad the pistons won
i hate the lakers seriously hate them
especially devean george annoys me
he is like a leech that just hangs onto kobe and shaq and then when he needs to contribute he cant step it up
when detroit went on a run in the 3rd rip was running a break after a board and george was trying to guard him but he is too slow so he just flopped
thankfully he didnt get the call but i cant stand players like that see vlade divac
anyway the only laker i really respect is kobe
at least he tries all the time unlike his team for the most part
he really is a great player
now that i think about it i dont have much against shaq
i just hope the pistons can pull this off
on a side note has anyone seen that viagra commercial with the fat and old guys jumping around with queen we are the champions playing in the background if you think about it there are some disgusting implications there
i get so sick whenever i think about it
therefore i will try to make you sick as well
sorry its too late to change anything
i believe i will go get some sleep now
have a great friday now that it is officially friday
it has been awhile since i got up as early as 519
nbsp it wasnt that bad actually
nbsp i got to the course before it was open so i ended up teeing off around 635
nbsp i ran into this guy from the grounds crew that absolutely hates me 4 times this round
nbsp i hit into him once while he was mowing the green andnbspi thought he had seen me
nbsp now he interrogates me every time like did you check in with the starter then who was there and you shouldnt be starting this early give us a chance to mow these
nbsp its very frustrating especially when i see him yukking it up yes i just said that
nbsp its a cool phrase
nbsp of course he might just hate me bc i am young or something
nbsp i have a lot to work on so i struggled at least in the scoring category but i hit the ball pretty well
nbsp i only had 1 birdie though
nbsp need to work on that
when i went to the parking lot to leave i found that there was a beer delivery truck right in front of my car with no possible escape so i was stuck there for about 10 minutes
nbsp i just thought i would share that since it was a minor annoyance
nbsp i made it throught that though
in other news the saturn is working again
nbsp the battery was indeed dead so my mom took it to the shop for me and its all better hopefully
nbsp now i dont have to give my dad a ride to work again which means getting up 20 minutes earlier
i was driving to my golf lesson today and i saw a hitchiker on the entrance ramp from 23 north onto 270 east
nbsp for those not acquainted with i270 it is basically a circle around columbus i guess there is one in st louis as well and then i70 runs through both cities too
nbsp anyway i found this a humorous spot to try to catch a ride
nbsp she wasnt going to get any farther than 25 miles from where she started yes i know people can take exit ramps onto other highways it was just funny
nbsp i am considering starting a new blog for stuff i see on the road
nbsp i probably wont but its a consideration
nbsp now if i was a trucker or something i would definitely do this and i would love to read something like that
nbsp many interesting sights out there
the dispute thingy from aim has been cleared up thank goodness
nownbspi can sleep which is great since i am leaving at 540 tomorrow leaving not waking up
nbsp this is bc the saturn wouldnt start
nbsp i think it is the battery so its getting towed tomorrow
nbsp meanwhile i will drive my dad to work then go play golf after that
nbsp i think im going to bed within a halfhour
i started reading jane eyre tonight and i fell asleep about 30 pages into it
nbsp i think it was me being tired as opposed to it being boring which was the case with texas by james michener which put me to sleep 4 times
nbsp that book took me so long probably twice as long as any other book i have ever read
nbspliterally maybe not the bible but thats it
nbsp jane eyre is actually fairly interesting even in the beginning
nbsp i have high expectations for it now
one other thing i was on espn
com nbsptoday and i was reading about bad athleteturnedmusicians and they had audio clips
nbsp one was pro wrestlers or something
nbsp here is a link to some 30 second clips the worst one in my opinion is track 10
nbsp its like elmer fudd meets a 3year old banging on a pot or something
nbsp definitely a must hear
nbsp if that doesnt keep you up all night nothing will
well yesterday i was talking to various people on aim and i think i managed to get 5 or 6 people mad in some way or another
nbsp all bc of a misstatement
nbsp this is why i dont like talking on aim bc you cant clarify things and they can get out of hand
hopefully things will work out i think they will
nbsp like i said earlier i hate having people mad at me
nbsp i cant sleep and i get all stressed out
nbsp i think thats bc of my analytical mind which makes me constantly thinking about the whole situation
i did talk to ryan my friend from florida now kentucky yesterday and he is probably coming up this weekend
nbsp if he does i think he might stay with me
nbsp i havent seen him in so long i am kind of worried that he has changed
nbsp people tend to do that
nbsp i was just teeing off on 1 w nobody in sight when a guy came up behind me and asked if i wanted to play alone or not of course i said you can join sure blah blah blah even though i didnt really want to
nbsp it was and older guy named john hes been a member there for about 20 years
nbsp he was nice enough but he kept complaining about how bad he was playing
nbsp that gets kind of annoying
nbsp then on 10 we were joined by another older guy named joe from alabama
nbsp the good thing about those 2 is that they were pretty fast but we ended up being stuck behind a group the entire time so my round took about 3 12 hrs
nbsp i almost holed out for eagle on 12 a par 5
nbsp i laid up to about 100 yards then i took a halfpitching wedge and stuck it about 4 inches from the hole
nbsp that was easily the highlight of my day as i did not play very well yes i am a hypocrite for complaining about golf but this is why i have this blog to complain and so forth
nbsp at the beginning of the round every time i stepped over the ball i knew i was going to hit a bad shot
nbsp it has been a few years since that happened
nbsp i did par all 4 par 3s though kind of
nbsp they kept giving me putts whenever i hit it within 3 feet or so and hitting them back to me
nbsp oh well its probably for the better that i didnt have an official score
my senior picture photo shoot went well as far as i could tell
nbsp i felt a little awkward with some of the poses like when i was lying on the floor and he was like roll towards me a little bit
nbsp i felt like a bikini model or something since i obviously know exactly what that feels like
nbsp that withstanding i think everything should turn out well
nbsp when i first talked to him today he said if i remember correctly you tend to blink a lot
this was bc he took the golf team pictures outside last fall and i was staring into the sun
all bc i wanted to have the girls soccer team in the background nbsp i think it was worth it
nbsp i only blinked during one picture today though
nbsp i have no idea when i will get the pictures back or at least see them
i finished the hunchback of notre dame today finally
nbsp i honestly have no idea how they made a wishbone episode out of that book
nbsp 75 of it is not suitable for little kids
nbsp that is on the conservative end too
nbsp it was quite a depressing ending and the entire book was kind of scattered as well as morbid
nbsp i have mixed feelings on it
next up is jane eyre which i think is the ultimate chick book
nbsp my mom reads it pretty much every year
nbsp i am looking forward to this less than i was rebecca
nbsp i think its the longest book i have to read too
nbsp i guess i will have to suck it up at get it over with rightnbsp yes
last night i was at a party at chads and brad told me he knew a kid named john corkendorfer in michigan
nbsp i found this quite enlightening
nbsp this has got to be one of the coolest names ever
nbsp seriously say it out loud and you instantly feel cool
nbsp when you get mad say john corkendorfer and you will have no choice but to be happy
nbsp i got to see some people i hadnt seen all summer last night which was nice
nbsp now i kind of want school to start so i can see some of my friends again
nbsp we just hung out all night really
nbsp we played catchphrase too
nbsp one word i got was chain so i said of fools which nobody got so then i started singing of fools
nbsp i think everybody on the other team knew it but nobody on my team did
nbsp heather seemed to enjoy my performance at least
nbsp if im going to make a fool of myself somebody should at least get it right
nbsp another phrase i got was jake and the fat man
nbsp i was like what the heck is thisnbsp i still have no idea
nbsp anyway i got home late and still forced myself up early todaynbspto go golf
nbsp i got to the course around 730 and found that there was a tournament so i had to go back home
nbsp i slept for a few hours after that
nbsp i woke up and my mom told me to go scrub the trash barrel
nbsp not sure when this became my job but it smelled terrible
nbsp it was not a pleasant experience
nbsp after this i went with some people to see i robot i had been delaying this movie for awhile since i thought it looked dumb
nbsp it actually wasnt bad at all
nbsp i was pleasantly surprised once again
nbsp then we went to chipotle
when we were outside eating we witnessed some road ragenbsp 2 kids in a beat up crown vic were following some lady and when she parked they pulled up next to her
nbsp when she got out they got out and started yelling and swearing at her
nbsp she was like 50 years old
nbsp i can understand yelling at a peer or something but if you want to act tough dont yell at an old lady
nbsp kids these days they have no respect nbsp after this we went to codys and hung out
nbsp i played him in pingpong and i lost 2110 2022 1 2220 1
nbsp it was a good match once i warmed up
nbsp he is the only person who ever beats me with any frequency probably bc he plays tennis all the time and also bc he knows to hit to my backhand
and thats my little update on my life over the past 2ish days
nbsp pictures are tomorrow at 10 am so no golf in the morning
nbsp all the outfits are ready to gonbsp i will let you know how it all turns out and maybe post them if i can figure out how at least once i get them back
i am sorry for the redundancy ironic given the title
ha of writing about the cant live a day remix of avalon by dj tiesto
nbsp i forgot i wrote about it the 1st time
nbsp anyway i guess this means i like it a lot
nbsp i probably didnt even need to post this as nobody else would have noticed
nbsp oh well i have satisfied myself and my oc if you dont know what oc means read this months archives
nbsp good night this time for real
there is so much good music out there that nobody knows about
nbsp today i stumbled upon andy hunter actually i had heard of him but i hadnt listened to him who i guess is considered the 1 christian dj at least in the trance realm
another song i found is a remix by none other than dj tiesto on the song cant live a day by avalon
nbsp this is all on radious christian rock station in columbus electrik cirkus i think thats the spelling playlist
nbsp theres a link to the radiou homepage in the sidebar my favorite radio station here is one right here to the electrik thingy page
nbsp apparently they spell it electric circus
i could have sworn they did something weird w it
i was thinking about what to do tomorrows top 5 on so i turned to chad for help
nbsp since the topic will suck you have him to blame
nbsp this is the eye of the brainstorm
i just thought of that
that was pretty good huh rogerclam73nbsp whats a good topic to do a top 5 type thing onnbspnbsp headoflettuce43nbsp movies rogerclam73nbsp i dont really like movies that much remember headoflettuce43nbsp oh yeha headoflettuce43nbsp um bands rogerclam73nbsp something more interesting w some oomph
nbsp as in oomph headoflettuce43nbsp knbspnbsp headoflettuce43nbsp strippers rogerclam73nbsp shut upnbspnbsp nbsp headoflettuce43nbsp lolnbspnbspim thinking
that was just to get the juices flowing rogerclam73nbsp not very well headoflettuce43nbsp lol oh ty rogerclam73nbsp something random other than strippersnbsp headoflettuce43nbsp lol nbsp headoflettuce43nbsp vegitablenbsp rogerclam73nbsp k so there you have it i am doing my top 5 on vegitables tomorrow
this title has no significance to the post that i know of i just wrote it
nbsp i feel obligated to title these things
yesterday we did not end up seeing the bourne supremacy bc they were out of tickets
nbsp so we went to codys and rented the bourne identity instead
nbsp i had forgotten how much i liked that movie
nbsp i heard the new one isnt quite as good but its still pretty good
nbsp they went to see it today but i couldnt bc i was golfing with my dad
nbsp i didnt play very well but we had fun even though it took about 5 hours
nbsp i hate golfing weekends and afternoons bc it takes forever
nbsp a 5hour round takes up the entire afternoon but if you can sacrifice some sleep and tee off at 630 it takes 3 hours max and nobody else is even awake so you have the rest of the day free
nbsp i guess that in europe everybody plays 3 hour rounds even foursomes
nbsp if i ever go to england i will have to go play some golf there
nbsp it seems too good to be true
i went shopping yesterday for senior picture outfits as well as general wardrobe maintainance
nbsp i got a polo at j crew its kind of cobalt blue with narrow white horizontal stripes then a kelly green polo at gap and a navy long sleeve button up shirt from ralph lauren
nbsp i think the last one is the only one im wearing for pictures the other ones are just for some variety on the course
nbsp next up is a red or pink polo shirt hopefully in time for tryouts
nbsp also i need a new hat to go with the kelly green shirt
nbsp i am thinking maybe a white visor w green accent if i can find one
nbsp if you want to think of what you should do in this situation i would be wearing very light khaki shorts with a brown leather belt and blackbrown alligator skin golf shoes w short black socks
nbsp in case you were wondering
nbsp actually i would greatly appreciate input on this
nbsp if i cant play well i should at least look good another great song i found really quick cant live a day remix feat
nbsp great great beat get the song or album o2 avalon remixed
yesterday i wasted about 6 hours of my day working on tech stuff at church
nbsp i was helping with a vbs followup service and my responsibilities amounted to hitting play and stop on a dvd player
nbsp they could have had a kindergartner do it
nbsp then i helped tear down aka winding up some cords
nbsp i did get to see some of my kids from camp though
nbsp one kid kept jumping off the stage onto me at the end then he pretended that he hurt his ankle
i said if you keep doing that your ankle is really going to hurt
nbsp all in good fun of course
i played 9 holes again today and i feel fine anklewise at least
nbsp i played so well but i putted like
trying to think of something that is bad at putting
nbsp have you ever had 4 3putt bogeys in 9 holes i did
nbsp another interesting factnbspfollow closely a bit confusingnbsp i was as many over par on the holes where i hit the green in regulation as i was on the holes where i didnt hit the green in regulation all you nongolfer types ignore that
nbsp anyway i hit 6 out of 9 greens had 20 putts yes 20 and shot 42
nbsp very frustrating but encouraging as far as ball striking was concerned
i think i am going to go see the bourne supremacy tonight not sure when
nbsp i dont really like seeing noncomedy movies that much but this looks pretty good
nbsp i will rate it tomorrow probably for you since you respect my opinion so much
i got the u chicago uncommon application they are quite proud of this title yesterday
nbsp i looked at the essays and they are much better than the common app
nbsp not sure which one i am going to do
nbsp i can post them here if you have any suggestions as far as which one i should do feel free to drop a comment
nbsp here you go i just looked at them again they are too long to type i will summarize
here we go again 1 write an essay somehow inspired by superhuge mustard like at sams club 2 talk about how language sets people apart covering peculiarities of your own personal language how does it make you unique etc
3 any law that uplifts human personality in just any law that degrades human personality is unjust wrote mlk jr in letter from birm
give your thoughts on justice as it relates to human personality
4 i have already decided this is too confusing and not that interesting so im not doing it
nbsp plus its about twice as long as any other essay so i will not write it
nbsp apply to u chicago yourself if youre that desperate to see it 5 write your own essay question like applicants did for 1 and 2
nbsp i am leaning towards 1 or 2
nbsp i think they can learn a lot more about an applicant this way than by saying how did you respond to an ethical dilemma or who has had an impact on your life so this application might actually be enjoyable
i downloaded a new song last night called amazing by george michael
nbsp its good but nothing special
nbsp the preview only lets you hear the first 30 sec of the song which were good but the rest was kind of repetitive
nbsp i guess its a dancepop mix with very few vocals
nbsp its not a listen to on repeat song for me though
yes this is my secret identity i have been hiding it from you this whole time
nbsp not even tiger would have teed off when i did this morning
nbsp it was raining so hard
nbsp when i got there at 730 this morning yes i cheated and set my alarm an hour later last night i need to ease into this 544 stuff everybody was hiding in the clubhouse from the rain or something
nbsp i was like to the manager can i go out and he was like i think its unplayable but you can try if you want and i was like whoa and he was like woot
nbsp after this dialog i teed off in the rain and since i didnt warm up and my hands were already wet i kind of duffed the tee shot and the rest of the shots on that hole and i got an 8
nbsp it didnt help that there was a creek where there wasnt supposed to be 100 yards out with more tributaries than the nile river delta i thought of that one when i was on the course
nbsp not bad ehnbsp then the green was kind of flooded too
nbsp i got used to the rain after that and i ended up shooting 45 which would have been decent to poor before injury so i was quite encouraged
nbsp i didnt play that well but i didnt play poorly either so it was a successful round
nbsp i didnt get hurt at all except on 9 i jumped up to see if i was on the green and i kind of forgot about my ankle
nbsp then i remembered it
nbsp its fine now though
so a good experience all in all
apparently i have to go do some technical stuff at church tonight for some kids service
nbsp i didnt learn about this until today so i am a bit irritated but its ok
actually you would be better off reading one of the other post not a whole lot to say
nbsp i am not relishing the thought of getting up at 544 tomorrow morning after about 3 weeks of sleeping in every morning
nbsp plus there are supposed to be thunderstorms which according to my dad are incredibly deadly
nbsp if i get struck by lightning i would rather it be on a golf course
nbsp anyway i like playing in the rain
nbsp i guess it makes me feel tougher than most other golfers shut up golfers are among the toughest people out there
sometimes we go 5 or 6 holes wout a cart girl
nbsp seriously though i get a sense of pride and dedication when i play in a downpour plus it is a change from the usual scorchiness
i have a link to a website i found today that i guess is sweeping the nation here
nbsp its basically making fun of kerry and bush which gives it a widernbspappeal
nbsp quite funny imo although its already gotten a little old
nbsp i would limit viewings to 5 or fewer personally
nbsp it has a little profanity but that never killed anyone i hope not at least
one other thing is it even debatable that seinfeld is the best show ever on tv it is the only show where i can still crack up even if ive seen it 3 or 4 times before yes i just watched it on tbs bless you ted turner
wow i never thought i would say that
please keep the reruns on forever i have to go to bed so early tonight its not funny
i dont have much time for this post dinner but since i might not be able to get back on tonight here is my post in a nutshell
hit a jumbo bucket at the range today and my ankle held up ok so i am going to play at least 9 holes tomorrow trembling w excitement this means that you will once again be subject to me describing my rounds but im sure you missed reading that as much as i missed writing it sidenotenbsp ironically when i was typing writing i accidentally wrote writhing
maybe its a subconcious impulse or something
nbsp so i am excited about that
nbsp i got my yale application in the mail today
nbsp i looked over it i guess theyre part of the common app which i kind of hate
nbsp the essay questions are so ridiculously stupid and broad that i have no idea what to write
nbsp these essays are everywhere and i hate them
nbsp for my sat ii writing test i ended up writing about my friend sliding across my car hood in the rain like dukes of hazard and denting it
come on who wants to read this
nbsp then in 9th grade proficiency testing i wrote about arthur yes the tv show on pbs
nbsp to summarize this i hate nonspecific essays
nbsp something should be done like say write about an animal the same color as your favorite color and starts w the same letter as your first name and their experience at the fair or something like that shut up you try and think of something specific and relevant
this parenthetical statement kind of justifies the broad essay
one more thing it has been an incredible last 2 days being a fantasy baseball owner w travis hafner on the squad
5 hr and 11 rbi last 2 games means i am moving up in my division wout having my pitchers play 2 starters pitch tomorrow
this last section is not bc anybody cares about my fantasy baseball trust me
i have never found anybody that cares about this other than my 10th grade english teacher
i am just excited that a 1b is outproducing most pitchers
nbsp so yes thats about it and im going to go eat
nbsp until the next post
today was much more relaxing than yesterday except not being able to get to sleep until 430 i think i talked about that last post
nbsp i hit a large bucket today at the range and i felt fine
nbsp i think thursday is still a realistic target for playing at least 9 holes
nbsp i got home and got on aim and i guess chee is staying at her sisters boss house so i got to talk to the boss daughter naomi
nbsp we talked for about 3 hrs straight she is one of the most fascinating people i have ever talked to
plus she is a huge college football fan i am in heaven
nbsp after dinner i decided to rearrange my room according to the plan i drew up in my mind last night while trying to get to sleep
nbsp moving the stuff is kind of hard by yourself but i managed
nbsp it didnt turn out quite like i was hoping but it looks pretty good imo
nbsp i just needed a change
nbsp that took about 2 hrs so now i am at the computadora again
nbsp i just discovered paul van dyk another trance artist kind of like dj tiesto
nbsp this genre is pretty new to me but if all trance is like this wow is all i can say
nbsp where would music be wout scandinaviansnbsp i am swedishish so i can say this wout being racistnbsp i need to go out and continue our tradition or something
nbsp i actually talked to chad about bringing back our band retalliation of the lamp
i guess its more or less trance now that i think about it so im going to call lucarse when he gets back from soccer camp
nbsp yes and then we can tour the world while were at it thank you goodnight all star united as well as probably a lot of other people
last night i went to bed around midnight but didnt end up sleeping until 420
nbsp so i got some thinking done
nbsp i was looking around my room for paper and i came across a notebook that i wrote in last time this happened
nbsp i enjoyed reading it so i decided to post them
nbsp keep in mind that i had just finished reading a 1000 page book about the last 500 years of society and civilization and how we are at the end of an age called from dawn to decadence by jacques barzun very slow read but fascinating so these might reflect on that
nbsp its basically just observations
machiavellis might makes right this might have actually been nietzche not sure makes truth arbitrary
as long as god is the standard of truth i see no problem with this
nbsp although truth is within god i see no problem with saying god defines truth by defining himself
nbsp tradition is undervalued in society
nbsp people want only to preserve themselves not themselves in relationship to others which is what tradition is
nbsp spending a halfhour a day smiling when you dont feel like it will do you more good than all the money in the world
not sure about that one nbsp if people say that shorthand caused the death of penmanship i would argue that it creates a written language all its own
nbsp neatness is not necessarily having an appearance of utter cleanliness but more a knowledge as to the whereabouts of any involved object at any given time
nbsp randomness is never really random at all at least pertaining to humans
nbsp rather it is spawned from a desire to be separate from the expected and more importantly an allencompassing view of the expected
nbsp an understanding of the entire self is impossible
nbsp when you search fornbspa cretain facet of yourself you rarely find it but instead learn many unexpected things
nbsp there are more but they arentnbspthat interesting to me
nbsp im not sure how i feel about all of these now but i thought that they were at least worth posting
i can hit a golf ball againnbsp yes according to the calendar it has only been 13 days since i could last do this but it seems like months
nbsp i cant tell you how ecstatic i was
nbsp i was in the backyard working on my backswing with my dad and he said why dont you try a slow weight shift and see how it feels so i did and it felt fine
nbsp i then worked up to a full hard swing and that didnt hurt either so i went to the range immediately and hit a bucket of balls
nbsp i was a little rusty but that was to be expected
nbsp my goal is to hit every day this week and hopefully i can play a full round by thursday
nbsp this feels like my whole summer has been reborn
nbsp plus i found out tryouts are a week later than i thought they were so optimism is permeating my being not usually the case
that was in the evening
nbsp the rest of my day sucked
nbsp i slept in and when i got up i read some more hunchback of nd
nbsp then i went to the library to see if some cds i wanted to burn were in yet
nbsp however when i got there i felt extremely nauseous
nbsp i left and flew home just in time to throw up in my own toilet
nbsp i went through 3 series of this which was accompanied by a throbbing headache
nbsp it was one of those situations where although you know you will get better pretty soon you are so miserable that you wish you were dead
at chads yesterday we ordered out some indian food which looked nasty but i figured it was ok to eat
nbsp i am blaming this for my illness
nbsp after being sick i took a nap for a couple of hours and i feel pretty good now but i am taking it easy and im going to go to bed early tonight
another good thing about today this was actually like 2 am this morning which i guess counts as today is that i downloaded a couple more sweet songs
nbsp my new repeat for a week until i get sick of it song is last train home by lostprophets
nbsp i heard this on the radio like a month ago sonbspi decided to get it and it is sweet
nbsp the other song i got is ocean avenue by yellowcard
nbsp my friends are obsessed with the band so i checked them out
nbsp not a particularly original sound but i like the sound anyway so it was another good findwhatever you call it

i enjoyed watching todd hamilton win the british open its hard not to be happy for someone like him
nbsp i would have liked to have seen phil win i am not a bandwagon fan he has been my favorite ever since when i was 6 my 1st visit to the memorial tournament when i found out he was a lefty like mejust for the record but anyway hamilton held up very very well
nbspi cant imagine how nervous he was when els was birdieing everything at the end
nbsp but how does this major record lookmasters 1stus open 2ndbritish o 3rdat the beginning of the yr would you have said that belongs to phil mickelsonnbsp any guesses on what he will get at the pganbsp i will say 4th just for patterns sake after watching the playoff i went to get my suit for senior pics
nbsp no armani but it is nice enough
nbsp i can pick it up tuesday after alterations
nbsp im not overly excited for the pics but it has to be done
nbsp i think they will turn out ok hopefully
after this i went over to chads and helped him hook up a new computer and install stuff on it
nbsp aim wont work though bc of some stupid popup blocker
nbsp we didnt really do anything just messed around and talked mainly about his vacation
nbsp it was nice to see him again not like i ever go more than a week wout seeing him
nbsp i was going to go to youth group at heritage with the youngs but they didnt have it this week
i wanted to play in the tournament tomorrow but my parents wont let me
nbsp its probably for the best as i would embarass myself but i really want to start againnbsp i should stop posting these gripes but its what is currently going on in my mind so i guess i wont nbsp i believe thats all ive got for nowfollow the day and reach for the sunthe polyphonic spree light and day seriously this is the coolest song ever at least for the next week until i get sick of it
people are finally coming back from vacation chad got back last night from the carribean and cody and phil just got back from nc
keith is done with his fair i guess he is the 4 western rider in the country did not know that
and then a big surprise my friend from elementary school that left in 6th grade to florida has moved to louisville so we are going to do something soon
maybe a reds game bc thats kind of in between
this is quite exciting i havent seen him in about 4 yrs so now i can stop sitting around moping about the ankle its getting better i think but i still cant do a full swing
i got invited to the final championship tournament for the league that im in on monday
i guess its only for the top people in the league so im not sure why i was invited oh wait the league kind of sucks but i cant go anyway
last nights thing at church went well enough
austin was there and he remembered me
there was a little drama between he and a girl there who was listening to hilary duff on headphones and let out random shrieks a lot very high on the unintentional comedy scale
the tension was eventually diffused so the night was altogether enjoyable
i forced myself out of bed this morning so i could watch some of the british open
it honestly wasnt that interesting to watch
i was glad to see phil and tiger making moves
i used to hate tiger but i feel kind of bad for him now plus he signed 2 autographs for me at the memorial tournament
sidenote todd hamilton the leader after 3 rounds i actually picked him for fantasy golf during the us open
that really isnt that relevant
i have read about the first 100 pgs of hunchback of notre dame
talk about a slow starting story
after the first 30 pages it picks up but i was worried
another annoying thing is that there are about 5 other languages interjected into the book and i only remotely know one of them french
but it is getting more interesting as the story progresses
well i am going to early church tomorrow so i can see more of the open so goodnight
that means obligatorycompulsory which means it seems to be what youre supposed to do as i blog surf at times i notice a lot of 100 facts about me posts so i figured i would go for it
i am already intimidated by this 2
i am pretty shy unless i feel comfortable 3
i despise small talk 4
i can honestly say that i like all music except country which imo doesnt qualify as music 5
i actually do believe that track is a sport sorry cody 6
i think going to the movies w friends and doing nothing else is a waste of time 7
i think that college football and nfl are 2 completely different sports w college vastly superior 8
there is not 1 team in ncaa football that i do not hate other than ohio state
honestly i have gone over this many different ways
i get bit by mosquitoes more than anyone i know 10
i have difficulty saying no to other peoples requests 11
i have noticed that by saying yes good things happen usually 12
i am a bigger tipper than either of my parents 13
this is bc i know what it is like to have a job that depends on tips 14
this is also bc i dont have a mortgage to pay 15
i absolutely love going to rock concerts 16
my first time crowd surfing was the most exhilarating experience i have ever had until i got dropped 17
i believe everything happens for a reason 18
if you keep an open mind and have perspective you can usually get an idea of this reason pretty easily 19
this saves you time by cutting selfpity significantly 20
i should listen to my own medicine 21
i cannot live with myself when someone is mad at me 22
i have only had one person in my life absolutely abhor me 23
it was a middle school teacher 24
one day in class i was kidding around with my friends and quoted some bible verse about humility
she walked up behind me and said why dont you practice what you preach mr
i still have no idea why she hated me 26
i have difficulty accepting complements 27
i feel that by accepting complements about my intelligence mainly i am taking credit for that which i did not do bc god made me this way 28
then when i say its a gift from god or something like that i feel corny and kind of rude as well 29
i guess there are worse dilemmas in the world 30
i am getting a little stressed about college applications starting soon 31
i have not yet been motivated to start this stuff 32
once i get motivated i should be fine 33
except for the interviews 34
i hope that the interviews are not phone bc i hate talking on the phone other than w friends 35
i already did a phone interview w an mit guy and i spent an hour listening to him talk about cryogenic freezing research
i felt like an idiot after i hung up bc i was not impressive i am sure 37
i dont think i will have to worry about going to mit now 38
my mom saw my senior schedule and told me what she could remember 39
it appears quite difficult 40
my 1st semester is govtecon h
calculus bible study hall internship 41
that will be my 1st study hall ever 42
english 12 bible and something else 43
i am glad i am a fast reader 44
i am proud of myself i made it so far wout mentioning golf 45
oops i just did 46
this was obviously preplanned since i could have deleted that 47
most people dont get my sense of humor until they know me for about 3 months 48
it is very dry and fairly sarcastic 49
i like it but the drawback is that people never believe you when youre actually serious 50
i wish that i could vote this year 51
i missed out by less than 2 months 52
this means i wont be able to vote for a president until i am 21
i guess 1 vote probably doesnt matter 54
that is just a fact not some unpatriotic statement deserving of execution on a basis of treason 55
my number 1 pet peeve is apostrophe misuse 56
this is ironic as i never use apostrophes on this blog 57
i guess it is the ignorance as related to the misuse like putting an apostrophe in visit one of our stores actually seen at sportmart at sawmill 58
another annoyance is people finishing my sentences constantly 59
the people that do this actually do not know what i want to say 60
actually this is more or less one person that does this 61
obviously it is not less than one person 62
i like to find humor in little things and ironies 63
i often wonder why gangsta rap has any appeal to suburban white kids but it does 64
my friend went to maine and apparently most of the teenagers there are kind of like brad in malibus most wanted 65
they call themselves maineacs 66
i can bluff really well when it comes to whether or not i have seen something like a tv showmovie 67
all you have to do is pick up little detailsscenes from previewscommercials and throw them into a conversation and nobody will suspect that you havent seen it 68
this is what i did w malibus most wanted 69
it works doesnt it 70
my dream career would be an investment banker on wall st 71
this is not what i had in mind in kindergarten 72
back then i wanted to be a carpenter a pga pro and somebody who goes around in a mickey costume at disneyworld 73
i dont think any of those dreams will come to fruition 74
i am completely fine with that 75
i am glad that i was more or less oblivious to pop culture during the 80s 76
everything about that decade seems hideous 77
that is another music style i dont like i guess 80s stuff like journey
i do however like livin on a prayer by bon jovi 86 79
i think that the best of the 80s 90s and today radio stations might as well be best of classical rap and heavy metal stations for all the similarities in the 3 genres
i consider myself to be very introspective 82
i would be willing to bet that this is a common sentiment among teenagers 83
this is bc introspection is part of finding your identity which is what all teenagers have to do 84
i like to think of introspection as an introduction to inspection which means its the first time you have seriously thought about anything of consequence 85
there are obviously exceptions to this but its a general rule 86
another thing that i dislike immensly is the whole feminist movement 87
i am all for equal rightspayetc but the rest of the movement is such a joke
they have such a chip on their shoulders its annoying
the world attitude is not going to win much support imo 88
they believe that they are better than men which kind of discredits their whole position that of gender equality 89
i just thought of that last one 90
i had another good one but i forgot it 91
i always sing along with my radio when i am driving alone 92
i also sing when my friends are in the car with me 93
this seems to annoy them 94
i cannot wait to get away from ohio and go to college 95
my life here is fine i just want to go live on my own and kind of start over 96
this is why i swear to myself that i wont go to ohio state that plus the fact that its huge 97
i will not however stay away from ohio stadium for the rest of my life or the rest of columbus for that matter 98
whenever i pass it on the freeway 315 i salute it completely serious 99
i can give you 100 reasons why osumichigan is the 1 rivalry in sports if i remember this will be my top 5 blog for michigan week 100
i did this whole thing in 1 sitting ha 101
not all of these were actually about me
youve been scammed that is it hopefully you know a little more about me other than this is an awkward subject a quick golf clap for paul casey and thomas levet who share the british open lead probably not the case by the time you read this
believe it or not levet was in that playoff in the open 2 yrs ago when ernie els won
casey might have been ryder cup for the brits not sure on that i dont care that much so i wont look it up
for now tomorrow i am helping out with the disabled kids at church
hopefully austin is there unfortunately we always play kickball or soccer over there and i cant do that
we can figure something out
i am an army of one
ironically i just got another solicitation from the army today
i guess they havent noticed that i have never responded to them
i can think of a good way for bush to cut military spending a little
stop sending this stuff out i finished rebecca today
when i get going i dont stop
it got so much better over the last half of the book
the first half is kind of dull bc it is all setup but i think that its all necessary
very very riveting finish although the ending last page only is disappointing
i will now recommend it to the majority of the populace
next up is the hunchback of notre dame
i think i saw a wishbone about this before actually i know i did
it shouldnt take very long
just got a new job today
once my ankle heals i am going to go pass out fliersflyers not sure on spelling at least i can be half right for my neighbors computer something or other business once i get more info i can solicit customers for him on my blog 10 an hr plus good exercise sounds kind of like single bag caddying except i know that i will be working every time i try
not much else to say except that i have once again dug out relient ks sophomore release the anatomy of the tongue in cheek and it is still incredible for more on this subject please see my top 5 blog
i am not really in a posting mood tonight
i am very tired which makes me grumpyirritable which i have been tonight
i did in fact get ncaa football 2005 today a dumb purchase since i will have to get 2006 next year in preparation for college and it is a very incredible game
the sound is so much better there is no comparison
there are other new things like actual sports illustrated covers for dynasty plus greatest game scenarios 97 rose bowl 03 fiesta bowl who won both of them thats what i thought the only dumb thing is that both of those you are supposed to beat ohio state
the antibuckeye sentiment pops up again this is a theme among the buckeye faithful that will be mentioned a lot more as football season approaches
wow less than 2 months that just hit me trembling with anticipation
the one annoying thing this will turn into more than 1 trust me is that the playbook changed and i was so used to 2003 so it is a bit confusing
also it is always kind of hard to learn a new game so it can be frustrating
all of this paragraph to say that i like the game very much
if you like college football who couldnt get it
i did in fact get to go chip at the driving range today
i got a small bucket and went through it a few times until my ankle started to hurt a little and then i left the balls there biggest waste of 4
also contributing to my early departure was an old guy that was chipping from a pot bunker directly across from me
i did however develop a new shot a low spinner that you bank into a hill of rough just in front of the green
this is a pretty common shot but i have never tried it before
i got it to become somewhat effective just need to practice more
i had a big scare today
my dad noticed that fluffy jr
one of my goldfish was belly up in my fishbowl but when he tapped it he came to
he seems to be fine now knock on wood cross fingers etc but that scared me to death and put me in a worse mood
my fish are almost 3 which is pretty old i believe
i know death is inevitable but i have grown quite attached to them
every time a pet dies i swear i wont get another one but i always do
speaking of the british open i guess it starts in about 2 hrs
here is a convenient link to the leaderboard
i dont think i have any more post in me
i have to go rest up so i can go do nothing tomorrow
not sure why i am even posting anything now probably just out of habit i guess
the allstar game kind of sucked as it was never really a game
it was cool to see the al hit for the cycle in the 1st inning thats about it
since it wasnt really worth watching i watched outback jack speaking of not really worth watching
it was at least better than other love reality shows like the bachelor crap
they use the hanging suspense stuff way too much though
it doesnt work as well when its that blatantly obvious another good example the davinci codeof course i would say that book sold oki still find it insulting to my intelligence
other than my fascinating tv watching nothing much happened today so thats about all i have to post
no great insights either and most importantly no obsessive compulsive thing i have to talk about here except listening to my new repeat songlight and day by none other than the polyphonic spree
their new album just came out together were heavy trust me it is incredible
listening to a song on repeat is not obsessive compulsive henceforth oc i am sick of typing that
sidenote i love whoever invented ace bandages the most comfortable form of support i can find and a lot cheaper too
here is a link to my new top 5 blog
there is also a link on the sidebar
i did basically nothing today other than get my haircut
i read about 100 pages of rebecca which is becoming to my horror actually enjoyable
i am borderline recommending it
life is kind of boring when i cant golf plus most of my friends are on vacation this week this always happens they go different places but all at the same time
i played ncaa football 2003 for the first time in almost a year i think
i realized it was set on jv very easy when i ran the opening kickoff back for a td
i think 2005 comes out this week and i am somewhat inclined to go get it
i should sleep on it
i think i am going to head out to the range tomorrow to chip if nothing else
i might try a few swings if i feel up to it
thats about all i have to post for today
i am going to go watch the allstar game in a bit go al since the tigers are going to make good use of home field advantage when they make the world series
a little baseball humor there
i might post again later tonight just wait and see
just an update on my basic blog format i have created a separate blog for my top 5
i will still update it every sunday and i can put a link to it on this page
i did this so it would be easier to access all of the archives of top 5 posts so you can be enlightened faster if this completely angers you and would cause you to boycott this blog feel free to comment but i probably wont listen anyway
in case you hadnt noticed i updated my profile to include this among my interests
anyway i decided to check out my last question find a word from a g o s in the handy dictionary and i answered my own question again wow who needs other people when you have yourself
the word is sago sago n a dry granulated or powdered starch prepared from the pith of a sago palm ad used in foods and as testuile stiffening with thanks to our friends at webster how on earth am i supposed to know that this is a word just thought i would update you on this so you arent kept up all night fretting about this
the british open apparently now the open championship starts thursday let us hope for a successful title defense by the local boy ben curtis sidenote i play at his familys course all the time and i got to hold and kiss the claret jug last year quite the experience
i have pics but they arent digital
in case you were wondering
now that i have peace of mind off for some more physical therapy
this post was longer than i meant it to be
yes this is the title of the song i was looking for last post
once i posted i thought why dont i just look for myself and lo and behold i found it in about 1 minute google search for hp commercial pictures
it is called pictures of you by none other than the cure i knew it sounded familiar
i actually found it on some message board about commercials
did not know of such things
anyway its a pretty old song but it is very catchy
hp gets great songs for its commercials there is another one that i like i am not going to search for it bc there arent any words to search for but someone in the marketing dept deserves a raise no my dad does not work there
went to the doctor today he confirmed that it is a severe sprain and that the earliest i could hit balls is in about a week which would leave me with about 2 weeks to get into peak form for the beginning of the season
i wish this wasnt going to be my senior year bc i dont want to go out on a negative
who knows maybe it wont be but 2 weeks without golfing is not helpful at all
if i had to be injured i would almost rather it be right before season so i would have a tangible excuse for the inevitable regression of my game that will occur sorry about the bout of verbosity i have to warm up for school coming up fairly soon
anyway i would like to go chip and putt at the driving range maybe starting weds or thurs who knows
this is really making my summer more difficult than what i had planned
my game seemed to be coming around too
yes i am quite despondent here
its just that i have done the exact same thing every summer since after 8th grade golfcaddy more or less every day and get about 100 rounds in each yr and i really enjoyed that whole routine especially now that i can drive
now i have to otherwise entertain myself and the only big positive is that i can sleep in
i really hope that some higher purpose for this incident manifests itself soon bc i am kind of annoyed about my situation
tomorrow i go to get my presenior pictures haircut
thankfully i got my mom to schedule it about 2 weeks a common time period for this post before pics bc i absolutely hate how i look for about a week after my haircut
i guess that is pretty common actually
speaking of senior pics i have to go get a suit soon
i am plugging for armani what do you mean 400 could be better spent on college
in addition to finding that song by the cure another band i stumbled upon today w a new release was the polyphonic spree
its kind of a rock group with a 20ish person choir
i had heard one song light and day before but i didnt know who it was
check them out you can listen to most of their songs on their website
i read a good chunk of rebecca today summer reading requirement and it has gotten more interesting than the beginning
its obviously written by a woman not meant as degradation i just noticed quite a few detailssentimentsother fantasies that no man i know would think of let alone write
i will let you know how it progresses
one more thing if anybody can tell me a word made up of the letters a g o s i would be grateful
i cannot come up with the word at all i even wrote down all 24 possible combinations and none of them seem like words to me
i am obviously missing something and this will bother me until i figure it out
what to post what to post i wont bore you with all of my ankle information like health updatesrehab endeavorsetc as that seems to be an oft mocked activity of the older set
i am going to go see a doctor tomorrow to see what i should be doing to help it as well as to find out when i can start golfing again within a week please
if i am able to caddy anytime soon i would assume that it would just be single bagging which is hardly worth it honestly
this would make for a very down year financially for me
i think i need to get a job with set hours instead of spending 3 hrs a day wishing i could do something to get paid
on the other hand 120 for 4
5 hrs work is very good money for a 17year old
on the first hand i can only caddy about 3 months out of the year
i will get back to you on this as soon as i get back to myself first
as i watched the trading spaces special tonight quite interesting especially finding out frank is married
to a woman i found myself wondering what happened to vern
he was my favorite designer on the show but they didnt profile him and i havent seen him on any new shows in quite a while
does anybody know if he quit or left or anything that would disappoint me quite a bit
another thing that was brought to my attention at camp had to do with movies
an 8year old kid spent half the camp talking to me about dodgeball and all the disgusting stuff like the pizza and the pump thing that ben stiller used in addition to michael jacksons escapades
i asked him when he saw it and he said he went to it with his dad
honestly people there is a reason these movies have ratings on them an 8year old should not be seeing this stuff and getting their minds screwed up by this although its completely fine for a 17year old
hmm this will probably be my lying in bed cant get to sleep thought of the night as i turn it over in my mind which is something i do a lot
anyway i just wonder why some people dont take this stuff into consideration when they are shocked that little 15year old junior gets an std or something
they are getting this stuff fed to them from early childhood
just a preachy opinion of mine to mull over if you wish
actually i havent fully considered this topic so i am still open to changing my stance
one more thing a couple of months ago there was a commercial for hp where there were kind of action photos and then photos were added to parts of them but they still fit not much of a description i know
anyway there was a song that had something to do with pictures something like the picture was all that i knew along those lines
that was an awesome song but i cant find it and i want to get that song or cd
if anybody knows what it was please please tell me
i will be forever indebted to you as well so you will have got that going for you
i am off to do more therapy
ever try writing the alphabet in capital letters with your big toe 10 times a day i hope not bc it definitely sucks
yes this is edition 2 of the weekly top 5
this is a big step towards consistency as i have not yet forgotten about this
about 2 more of these and i would think that this will have been solidified as a definite department of the blog
without much further ado this weeks top 5 is things i heard the most at camp 5 hows it going hoppy according to camp lore hoppy is some guy from 100 years ago who was made fun of bc he had a curved spine and a short leg
to make a long story short he was found dead in a cave frozen to death while clutching a fawn to keep it warm
since i was kind of hopping around w crutches this nickname was bestowed upon me and it spread quite quickly
it could be worse i guess
4 hows the ankle pretty selfexplanatory
as you hear this question more and more you kind of get a default answer without many details once you realize that they dont want to know that badly
3 i have to pee to be expected w 3rd grade guys
we had a buddy system which grew much more relaxed as the week progressed
my response went from get your buddy to just go in the woods or something
peeing in the woods is part of the camp experience right 2 my insert authority figure usually male such as dadgrandpa can insert impressive feat that is usually doubled in exaggeration as covered yesterday these kids still idolize their parentswhoever else
some of these stories were obviously fabricated some were probably true
another fun thing that came up a lot about parents was personal information such as dietsweightage of parents
these parents might want to rethink telling the kids this stuff
1 what did you do to your anklehow did you manage that imagine telling about 100 people literally that your injury was from something as dumb as jumping off of a slide from 1 foot off the ground
i would have liked my injury to have been from something a bit more respectable maybe i dived into the pool to save a kid from drowning or something like that
humility is a good thing
i am off to watch some us olympic trials for track field now then a 2hour special on trading spaces yes i am quite serious i happen to enjoy that show and no this does not mean i am gay some of the designers on the other hand
yes i am now back from my counseloring experience at summer camp and it was good for the most part
however it was a lot different than i had envisioned it being
about 3 hrs into the camp i sprained my ankle and even though about 200 people already asked me how i will tell you anyway
we were on a playground and i was going down a slide with some of the kids
it wasnt very slippery so i got stuck at the bottom
this was not a big problem so i hopped off the slide from about 1 foot off the ground but i rolled my ankle when i landed and i heard a really loud pop
i tried to walk it off for a few seconds but it hurt too much so i just flopped on the ground and had somebody get the nurse
i tried hopping back but it was kind of far so i ended up piggybacking on jordan another counselor type to the nurses officeyes i owe you one shut up
anyway i went to the er and i got crutches and an air cast and i felt good enough to stay even though i couldnt put any pressure on it i didnt want to disappoint my kids
let me tell you a summer camp in the woods with a bunch of hills and steps is not the place to have to use crutches
they are fun to play with but they suck when you need to use them
i saw myself in a mirror for the first time since tuesday and i have all of these bruise marks around my armpits from them
i think my injury could have been a lot worse especially with the pop i heard
i thought it was a ligament which would require surgery and since i could not move my foot at all it was quite possible
personally and you dont have to agree but i believe that god healed me enough that i would be able to stay
i figured that there would be a reason that it had happened to me and it turns out that there was
one girl was homesick so the director had me talk to her and she ended up staying and having a good time
other than that camp was awesome
i was worried that the kids wouldnt warm up to me immediately but they loved me always a good feeling and they listened to me for the most part
i was planning on messing around with them and running around a lot but i obviously couldnt very well but that opened some doors for more personal interaction
i taught some of them how to play euchre kind of
they still dont get following suit
thats like the easiest concept in the game
they got the whole bauer thing
they all helped me with my crutches and held doors and whatnot and when i got back from er late at night austin the autistic one that i was supposed to help had put a pillow and sheet on a spare bunk as a bed for my crutches
the kids got along pretty well
they were kind of annoyed with austin bc he made a lot of noises and so forth at night which kept them awake but they didnt really understand him that well which is to be expected
if you can understand him he is just the sweetest kid
as you can imagine with 3rd grade boys the expulsion of gas is quite the hilarity
one night somebody did this when we were at a campfire and everyone started falling over themselves laughing
then austin said i bet jesus is up there laughing in heaven it kind of made me wish i was a dad in a way
there was only one other major conflict in the cabin sort of an alphamale thing that was never really resolved only dissuaded but i guess that can be expected as well
i just cant explain how much i loved interacting with the kids and how they accepted you unconditionally and how i was kind of like their hero
i guess they are still at the age when authorities in their lives are still figures to be looked up to
i was surprised how often they were bragging about dadsgrandpaswhoever being incredible in some form
i guarantee that in 4 or 5 years they will be complaining about how annoyingstupid they are
my body is kind of beat up not just my ankle
my armpits are bruised my shoulders are sunburnt i have a million give or take mosquito bites and my back is quite itchy
throw in 2 brief showers and no shampoo over 5 days and a bath becomes quite appealling sp
sorry i had to complain about this
anyway it was more than worth it though
i made some new friends among the counselors even though i already knew them and they were all really nice even though my injury was a bit of an inconvenience
so yes i thoroughly enjoyed camp
at the end my counselor asked me if i would do this all over again and i said without a doubt
the one negative now is that i am going to be kind of bored until the ankle heals somewhat as i cant golf or caddy right now
i had to cancel mondays tournament
the golf season starts in about 3 weeks so i have to get better in about a week if i want to have any chance to get in good form
at least i can finish some summer reading
i will probably be posting more jewels about camp over the next week or so as this is quite the long post and i forgot a lot of the stuff i wanted to write
i will close with another austin oneliner
somebody else was making up a story or something so he said liar liar plants for hire kids say the darnedest things
the tournament today went ok
the course was pretty short cumberland trail not cumberland like i said last post but it was tough
a lot of of fairway bunkers trust me i would know and the greens were annoyingly fast i believe 12 on the stimp or so
very very fast to the casual golfer such as myself
so i limped home to an 88 which was good enough for 4th place
the field was a bit stronger this week and 77 won it
it was very hot and not cloudy at all during the round this will come into play soon
after this round i wanted to go see if i could get rid of my golfers tan very abrupt lines just above elbows and knees around feet right wrist golf glove and matching rubber band line neck sunglasses and a less noticable one across the forehead from my hat at the pool so i went over to chads house to go to the pool at medallion
of course it was a perfect day for tanning as the sun was nothing if not stifling and generally hot during golf
however during the 4 or 5 minute drive to the pool the weather went from sprinkling to torrential downpour with sheets of rain and no visibility at 30 mph
so we turned around and just hung out for a while
about an hour later it was clear again
so we got to go to the pool for a couple of hours
thankfully i didnt see anyone i knew
i am still going to be quite pale at camp 23 hrs of pool time every day
not much else to say i will not be able to post probably until saturday or sunday
aha i just watched william hungs video for we are the champions good stuff
i think he has gotten a little bit better but he kind of sucks
i feel really bad for him
i am all for some patronizing but people usually know when i am messing with them
to be so naive is quite remarkable
he sure isnt going broke though
only in america i guess
have a wonderful week and develop some coping methods to deal with my absence early in the week as opposed to late
i have just had a revolutionary concept
every sunday i will give you my opinion on my personal top 5 somethings
this is very tentative and it is more than possible that this will be the only one
with that in mind the first category is
music albums these are all from the last 7 or so years so there was never really consideration for any classic albums
as you can see most of these albums are from my favorite bands which is no coincidence
without further ado here are my top 5
a rush of blood to the head coldplay i got this cd last year and i listened to it on my way to every golf match
its very calming and i love every track from 17
just be tiesto this is that new to me at least trance album i have been raving about
the best song on it is by far the 1st track forever today which is probably in the top 5 songs hint hint for me
who says the london club scene is weak i think he is the 1 dj in the world
emajn cloud2ground another incredible technotrance album
this is what got me addicted to the tranceindie thing
the best 2 tracks are 1 raindown and 6 face2face which is the most beautiful song i have heard other than amazing grace on bagpipes and possibly lee greenwoods god bless the usa anyway its an awesome album except i dont really like the last 2 tracks
the 1st 7 are incredible 2
the anatomy of the tongue in cheek relient k this is the most diverse album up here
they always have a couple of goofy songs on their album the difference here is that those songs are really sweet im liono may the horse be with you
i also love the raw emotion in these words are not enough and for moments when i feel faint and down in flames and failure to excommunicate are awesome as well
the fact that this is not their most recent album yet it makes up about half their concert set says something about the strength of this album
ok computer radiohead how do i love thee
let me count the ways
about 9 as in 9 of the best songs ever actually track 7 doesnt really count but its funny anyway
35 kind of suck but it seems that every compilation cd i make has at least 3 songs from this album
the guitar solo in paranoid android is one of the best of the posthendrix era imo and electioneering is still my favorite songs even though it is about 7 years old
karma police airbag and climb up the walls the song that made me get
this cd in the 1st place
kid a and their newest one arent as good as this but radiohead is still a remarkable band
edition 1 of my top 5
if anyone has differing opinions there should be no differing with this list feel more than free to post a comment i would love to hear from you yes you
thats getting up there i say
i wonder how many more years we have in us i mean every great nation eventually collapses
i would think that this wont come anytime soon but in 150 or 200 years will we still be as dominant as we are today i think outsourcing is going to hurt us a lot more than most people realize
i hope that the tax incentives if there are any for keeping business in the country will be increased bc this could really get out of hand
i think labor in india is something like 5 or 10 times cheaper than in america
why would any businessman keep his factory in america in those circumstances i think the government needs to do something about this
anyway there is my cheery hopeful birthday wish to america
honestly i love this country and there is no way i would want to live anywhere else
darn it i am proud to be an american i caught the last halfish of legend of bagger vance on abc last night
i had heard it wasnt good so i never saw it but i actually liked it
one quote that really hit home was golf is a game that cannot be won only played
i think thats why i like golf so much and also why i am sick of competitive golf about 3 more months i think that at least for me the competition brought into golf by tournaments and high school matches kind of defeats the purpose of golf by making the competition with other people instead of yourself
i am surprised at how excited i am for next summers golfing just bc i know i will be able to golf without any pressure and i will be able to just have fun
the reasons i am not leaving the team in the first place are 1 my teammates are awesome 2 we have a great shot to win states and 3 i guess i would feel like i was quitting on myself and everyone else as well
so i will drag myself to tryouts in about a month and see where things go from there
speaking of competitive golf i have another tournament tomorrow
i have no idea where that is so i am going to go mapquest it
yes i am pretty sure those are actually fireworks outside thomas but it sounds like gunfire or maybe thunder
red white and boom was pretty cool
i went with cody chad and brad
we ran into robby and his ladies
we also met some girls who kept asking us for cigarettes
i guess it turned out that brad knew one of them so we hung out with them for awhile
we also watched a parade where i found out that they only give candy to little kids
even the political candidates in the parade do this which doesnt make sense since the little kids cant vote
i still got a stress relief ball from dominion homes the best of everything so i am happy the actual fireworks were pretty good and we beat most of the traffic out
then we went to codys house where we stayed up playing halo and watching tape delayed wimbledon matches until about 5
quite happy to see sharapova win no not bc she is incredibly hot
i just dont really like serena
on a side note brad was telling me about his girlfriend from quebec that he is going to hang out with in florida next week
i told him to tell her tais toi which is french for shut up but i told him it meant i love you
dont tell him he will forget anyway
i will be so proud of myself if it works messing with people can be fun to an extent
i am going against one of my principles right now and listening to a britney spears song on repeat everytime
i am definitely not a fan but this song is really incredible
it has a slight resemblance to evanessence at times
i think they are one of the groups that will change the face of popular music groups like genesis creed boy bands duran duran as far as the last 20 yrs
they created a unique sound whenever i hear a new song of theirs on the radio i can always tell who it is
more and more bands seem to be imitating them
personally i like this movement there is more of a rock sound with more edge to it while it doesnt diminish the vocals at all
theres my musical analysis for the month more like my whole life
ps those fireworks on the last post looked a lot better in the create post box than they do on the actual site
blogger is not being particularly prompt in the area of posting stuff
i posted like 3 hrs ago and it hasnt come up yet on the site
unlike last time i will wait and not repost which could make me feel stupid
just got back from shopping for camp stuff
nothing terribly exciting happened except i saw a guy with about 4 teeth total
it was kind of disgusting but i felt really bad from him
i had thought columbus was kind of through with the hick image but i guess were not done yet
maybe he just chews tobacco a lot
very unhealthy habit might i add plus those spit cups are completely repulsing
just downloaded a new song called jesus walks by kanye west
it has been on power 107
5 columbus hottest hiphop and rb now i have probably listened to it about 10 straight times
i try not to do that bc it makes me get sick of it but its really good it confronts some issues that i have kind of wondered about for a while
heres a link to his website
anyway im heading downtown probably in an hour or 2
have a great holiday weekend here are some early fireworks for you god bless america happy 4th
apparently my 1st post did work it just didnt come up when i checked it
now you know i wasnt making it up though
you also know that i tried to make them similar cup o tea
golfed the same 9 holes twice this morning shot 4341
i started off w 2 double bogeys bc some old guy was right behind me so i rushed
i pride myself on being a fast golfer so i picked it up and i beat him to the turn by about 2 holes
played the 1st nine in 58 minutes which is top 5 for me
the second time around i was even through 6 holes then i finished bogey triple bogey
i got stuck behind a twosome in a cart
i waited for them on every tee from 13 to 17 but they wouldnt let me through
of course when i got to 18 they were like want to play with us
another annoyance on golf courses is people who honk when they drive by
its not like youre the first person to ever think about this its not that funny
somebody did that today when i was walking up to my ball
what purpose does honking have then am i going to screw up my walking i guess i can see how it would be funny actually
i still find it annoying tho
i am going to go shopping now for camp
ack cursed blogger erased my rather lengthy post
now i have to write it all over and it will never be as good as it was
today was another day consumed by golf
i played 18 holes this morning where i shot 83 and played fairly well and then i had a lesson this evening which also went well
i also finished a book called mafia cop
its about some guy who grew up with his family in the mafia but he became a cop
for someone like me who is fascinated by organized crime it was an interesting book
it wasnt incredibly wellwritten or organized but there was a lot of good stuff as i like to call it in there
its by bob drury and louie eppolito can you guess which one was the mafia guy if you want to check it out
next on my list unfortunately is a book for school called rebecca
it looks like some sort of romance novel which is not really my cup o tea
i guess i will just have to suck it up and read it
not sure why it was assigned
saw spiderman 2 last night with some people from school and youth group
it was pretty good it had more depth than what i expected
a little corny and some graphics web swinging from building stuff were kind of weak but overall i would give it 3
5 out of 4 stars yes movies are out of 4 stars not 5 like a lot of my friends think
its not a restaurant or a hotel very annoying
yes i am easily annoyed sorry
it makes me more interesting as a person
tomorrow i am going down to red white and boom largest fireworks display in the midwest with cody
i have actually never been before
i know there will be a squidgetload of people down there
i am predicting i will get mugged
i will carry minimal cash
thats about all ive got for now
ps the post title is the name of an article i read somewhere
its by a harvard professor so its obviously not conservatively biased
its an interesting objective view
im not taking sides on this but here is a link if you want to read it
have a great friday and be safe this holiday weekend as an excessive amount of coppage is expected to be present aka the popo
there you have it i can use ebonics as well as the next guy
there now i am really done
another day consumed by golf is under the belt
i got up early this morning and played 18 shot 83 so i was happy enough then i had a lesson this evening which went pretty well
i also spent a few hours reading a book called mafia cop about some guy who grows up with his family in the mafia but he becomes a cop yada yada yada
for someone like me who is really fascinated by organized crime it was an interesting book but it wasnt especially wellwritten or anything
now i am going to have to read rebecca for summer reading for school
it looks like some romance novel which really isnt my cup o tea
not sure why my teacher picked this book
i guess i will just have to suck it up and read it
or i could just use sparknotes
actually i dont think the book is popular enough to be listed
yesterday i went to see spiderman 2 with some people from my school and youth group
it was pretty good although some parts esp the ending were a bit corny and the special effects when spidey was swinging around were kind of weak
it had a surprising amount of depth to it though
i will give it 3
5 out of 4 stars so many people i know think movies are rated out of 5 stars ack its not a freaking restaurant or hotel its a movie out of 4 stars this is one of my fairly irrational pet peeves bear with me
i am going to red white and boom the largest fireworks show in the midwest with cody tomorrow so i wont be able to work
i guess there are about 1 million people there every year which is about as many people as there are in columbus
where do they come from west virginia
no comment on that one
anyway thats about all ive got for the time being
ps post title is the name of an article i read
here is a link to it
its by a harvard guy so its obviously not conservatively biased
im not taking sides on this its just an interesting and objective article
i have a semiinteresting story to tell you
wednesday i went golfing at medallion cc with chad they bought a guest package for me
buy 2 rounds get 1 free
or something like that anyway when we teed off it was perfect weather and i played ok
i made about a 60footer for double bogey on the 1st hole and i ended up with a 42 with 2 birdies on the first 9 rookery
then we went on to preserve where i was playing ok
after 4 holes chad pointed at the sky and said that sucks it was menacing he wasnt just antisky or something
i said that wont hit us until the end of the 9
on 5 tee the lightning siren thing went off but i was like just pretend you didnt hear it i am a negative influence
so as we walk to the green he gets out his umbrella and i made fun of him for being a woman obviously umbrellas arent for men banter etc
then a gust of wind blew it inside out and i said see god doesnt approve of transgenderedness it was funny just go with me on this
but wait thats not all
he set the umbrella down to hit a chip and it started to blow away
then he started cracking up and fell on the ground so i had to run it down
it actually jumped over a fence and went onto a fairly busy road sunbury rd for those columbus readers
a couple of cars had to go on the opposite side of the road to avoid it before i could get to it
needless to say we went in after that
unfortunately we were literally as far away from the clubhouse as possible so we enjoyed a 2ish mile walk in a torrential downpour
this red crap kept squishing up through my shoe
i still have no idea what it was but chad thinks it was gum
whatever it was when i took my shoe off my sock was covered in redness
my mom thinks it was dye from the brown part of my shoe
i honestly have never been that wet before other than when swimming
i literally could not take my shirt off until it dried for about 20 minutes
so there you have it
if you didnt find this at least somewhat amusing you might as well not read the rest of this blog as it is the quintessential example of my sense of humor either that or i didnt tell the story very well
that was more humor than you can shake a stick at
notice a theme with these titles dont worry i wont keep doing that
anyway i just found out one of the most annoying things you can do other than not tipping your caddy
next time you buy something cheap with cash like mcdonalds or something give the cashier more money than you need to
for instance if you get 2 double cheeseburgers and a small coke my usual order the total is 2
so i give them a 5 and two 1 which makes absolutely no sense
they kind of stare at the money and then go you gave me too much then you say can i have my change then
it is one of the funniest things ever if you have a somewhat malicious sense of humor as i do
i stumbled upon this by accident but now whenever im in a bad mood or something this helps me out
no i am not a complete jerk and if you feel like condemning me all of you people who read this let she who is without sin cast the first stone
i honestly dont think this would offend anyone though
now that i have made this post unfunny with my political correctness that i cant stand in other people i shall leave
i have found the secret to shooting much lower scores in golf play the womens tees dont laugh
today i tipped it out on the front 9
i hit the ball pretty well but my wedges were going everywhere except where they were supposed to
so i said if i play the womens tees on the back 9 i will have a wedge into every green at least par 4s
so i sucked up my pride and did that
i spent the majority of the time trying to think up tough comebacks for people who might make fun of me
actually that was probably fortunate as i couldnt think of anything other than explaining all of this which would take way too long
anyway i was bogeyfree on the back and i shot a 1 under 35
i hit a par 5 in 2 with a couple of 5woods 3putt par
ack and i had some sort of wedge into every other hole except 11 a par 3 that i hit 9 iron on
i figured that if people laughed at me they werent secure in their manliness unlike me
since i have not been blogging for very long you have not realized everything that has gone into my efforts to break 80 on 18 holes over the past 2 years since i broke 90
today all of those struggles finally came to fruition as i made about a 5 footer for a 78 on the last hole
i had to go 27 holes to get it and it was hot out today
i think 92ish with more or less no wind
so i am quite happy right now
honestly i think i will be satisfied with my golf career from now on as i hold no expectations of breaking 70 or anything
i am kind of busy right now so this is a short post but i just had to get this out there and spread the good news
yes it has been awhile since i posted as i was occupied with actually doing things with people and escorting ryan my friend who as he puts it is from florida but happens to live in kentucky around town
there might be something to this social stuff
i will attempt to make up for this with renewed vigor or not
i definitely wont use that phrase for awhile again
i dont think that he had changed that much which was a huge worry i had
i really felt sick when i was waiting for him to come
i think he has changed somewhat which is obviously natural and i have also changed even though i dont really perceive it
so we got along pretty well not as naturally as in elementary school or anything
it was more like somebody from church i see 2 or 3 times a month chemistry wise
the thing that disappointed me was that pretty much none of his friends from back in the day were available
they were all on vacation either that or they had some vague plans
so we ended up seeing a movie friday and saturday nights and just hanging out
we saw bourne supremacy friday with philip dan and andrew
then ryan wanted to go to walmart for no real reason
i dont know where any are although i know there are some so we settled for meijer
he showed me how to do a 720 in a shopping cart
i was kind of thinking you lived 5 minutes from the beach in florida and this is what you did
on saturday we drove around for a couple of hours literally looking for his old house which we eventually found
then we played tennis and saw manchurian candidate with cody
very confusing movie but im almost positive i had seen it before and no it wasnt the original version
ha it came to me
no im not completely stupid
then we watched a street something or other like a magician who didnt do much until the very end
i didnt know they had those in ohio
then we hung around easton for awhile
i had no idea how ghetto it got
i kept making stupid comments like oh theres ray allen i do that to people wearing jerseys
cant help it and ryan said one of these days youre going to get shot
it would be my honor to get shot for being dumb like that and it might just cure me
we went to church this morning and after lunch at panera he left
i think goodbyes are so much harder when its not somebody youre going to see the next day or week
maybe we can get together again when more people are in town
theres a lot more to tell but this is probably kind of boring and long already
i did get a few new cds just betiesto this is trance vol 2various and ocean avenueyellowcard
the various one is like 80 minutes of continuous dancetrance mix
i love it dearly so much so that it will replace a rush of blood to the head coldplay as my new pregolf cd
i may go over requirements for this later
ironically one of the songs is a mix of clocks by coldplay
i guess this genre is not for everybody im not sure how thats possible not to like but ryan could only take about 20 minutes of it as it was driving him crazy
the brilliance would be lost on someone who listens to country music
anyway i like other music too so im not incredibly strange at least as far as music is concerned
but honestly i dont see how one cant appreciate this music
you can just immerse yourself in the driving beat and bask in the intermittent glow that is the synthesizer
yes i am listening to that cd right now
i picture somebody gliding through a pool and then coming up with eyes closed and smoothing their hair back in carribbean crystal blue water at dawn with a sun and sky gradually lightening during the moment of transition from night to dawn to morning to day
it makes great reading music too
once you get into the book and the music at the same time your reading speed is driven solely by the beats
so when the drum and bass kicks in i probably read double time and i still know exactly what i read
of course country people could ridicule me for not recognizing their whatnot for the masterpiece that they hold it to be
beauty is in the eye of the beholder
i hate it when i use cliches
i also hate it when i cant put accents over french words
it defeats the purpose of using it
the espnusa today coaches poll college football was released last week and ohio state is 9
i guess si said we were overrated and candidly i think we might be
i mean we lost 75 of the dline and our punter jts favorite play is in fact the punt as well as qb 3 recievers not that the passing game was anything special
also aj trapasso our only punting recruit seems to have the most legal problems this side of willie williams ooh how does that feel canes fans oh wait there arent any real one
so i would put osu 14 or so
bob hunter a columbus sports columnist wrote an article about the counterproductivity of preseason polls and i agreed with it 100
so tonights top 5 will be my most overrated college football teams no i will not put osu in there just for loyaltys sake
yes i can do that
this post is already incredibly and annoyingly long so i wont make it much longer
feels good to be back
well ok i used to play tennis at this clay court here in singapore
its probably the only around so many expatriates go there for training
i met many people there the most memorable one was this indian boy that kept whining its just a game when i beat him 60
there was this boy too by the name of alistair that i used to play with quite often because his training slot was around my time too
his mom was such a nice lady and he was really such a nice guy
when i stopped going to the courts i never saw him again
only today 3 months after his untimely death did i know about it
apparently he went in his sleep with no medical records no problems the day before
the baffled the doctors and they could find no reason
my dad always repeats the same old catch phrase when someone dies so suddenly frailty of life
honestly if he cant find something fresh to say then he should shut his trap sometimes people feel better without the overly used words of wisdom
but really this death was a real bummer
how could someone so young be taken so early with no rhyme or reason
hes about my age so i inevitably started thinking what if it was me i really dont know whether i should feel upset or glad at his death
on one hand this guy just left his single mother standing on the edge of depression with his death
from my very short time with him i could tell there was a lot of love between the 2 of them
when something like that happens you naturally feel a little upset but this time the feelings different
its this warm fuzzy feeling in my heart that tells me not to be upset
well actually i dont know how to describe the feeling so i just used an old and cliched catchphrase
those who know me would also not know that ive been thinking about death ever since i reached a certain level of maturity
all along i had feared death feared the pain feared the thought of going to somewhere really really bad
then my thoughts matured and philosophy came into play
i knew what i wanted from this world nothing
ive all along wanted to die an early death of old age
all along ive wanted to live a short meaningful life and die a painless death
i thought death by old age was the ony way death would be painless but this death has opened up a whole new dimension for me
i really dont know why the thought of changing places came to me
i know if i were the one to die my family would be devastated
but they have my sisters dont they then again ive always been the special one
the one that has the most hope in life
that poor lady had and now has no one else
i feel so sorry for her but what can i do if the lord were willing if he called out my name i think i would really not hesitate
i think i would gladly swop his place for mine
by saying that im kind of implying that i have a really bad life
i have a really great one but if my death could do something so miraculously good as to bring mother and son happiness i would gladly do it
my only wish is that that could happen without me feeling pain
im a sucker for pain
im sorry yesterday i was all wierd and emotional
i just wasnt thinking straight because it was my last day in a place ive been living in for the past 2 years
anyway for those who wants my take on my day yesterday here it is
well my last day at school helped me discover a very under the radar player in class benjamin siow
i honestly did not have him on my list of targets and he just got 1 marks less than me in average
well what i can tell you is that he wont be able to go utr anymore of hes gonna get ready to get voted off
essentially i wont be the one getting him exposed ill let the fairplays do the job my dearest slaves anjan and jason will be all over this guy once they find him out i was also doing some bonding with the fairplays through a lame coin game
but it was really nice seeing another side of them not having to be playing the game
i was in a really good mood until a jenna awardee came into the game
well his name is samuel and his mouth shoots off like a donkeys ass once something remotely funny comes into conversation
not to mention his mouth smells like a donkeys ass
some very scientifically inclined people may like to compare his words to the speed of light and his brain to the speed of sound
a title that lets your thoughts run wild after the american idol finale im sure quite a few of you are expecting a commentary
sorry to those people because ive just been so touched by the song i believe and im gonna right about the finale of a phase in my life and the beginning of another
my dear friends would know that today was my last day at a place that ive detested and cursed for 2 years the boarding school
as i lay on my bed the one that always seemed so uncomfortable at night but so appealing in the day i heard the sound of something bead like falling on the floor
i looked in between the gape of the bed and the wall and there was this glass star the star that i had recieved on my first week here
i felt it extremely appropriate that i got the star back at the start of a new chapter in my life
enoch and ken wei helped to carry my stuff down and him waving as my car went off reminded me of the ending of the movie big fish where the characters of the persons life waved him his last goodbye without any tears but instead with joy
it is today as i wave goodbye to the shining star of miss barrino that ive grown the 10 inches more that mother has always wanted
today at school was a huge mess up
again and i realised i could actually play badminton
well that wasnt really the highlight of the day because i started to step up my little gameplan
as i said in the earlier post i need so badly to step up into fairplays shoes
guess what people im already on to it i initiated a whole chain of jokes about mr
im telling you by the crowds that surrounded my table i think i may be even better than i thought
today was also the 10th year anniversary for boarding school
ironic really that i announce my leaving on this day too
anyway it seemed like a farewell party all for me
the starters were really great
prawn salad or something like that
the clam chowder though a far cry from my mums standards was far better than i expected
away from the food the tiki torches outside really gave me a wierdly comforting feeling
i guess its because there are now torches for the survivor om in december
something in the hall really didnt feel right and it was because i was sitting next to a bunch of people that i used to be comfortable with but i am not comfortable with anymore
i was sitting with none of my friends cause they were all serving
and i just didnt feel good
i really dont know whether its because im leaving or because i found that i had no real friends
being in my class as i realized today is like playing a huge game of survivor
i find it appropriate that as a survivorfire writer i compare a few significant classmates to a few of our most loved most hated survivors
for your information i got back my exam results today and some more emerged as fairplays and even more dropped like flies
the first person im doing is a guy named ashok
he sits right next to me laughing his ass off all day
any survivor idiot can tell hes playing the game distracting others by ridiculing the teachers
before the exams he was on my fairplay list one that really had the potential to do well but was valiantly concealing it
when the results were returned he dropped to a john marquesas award
he definitely outwitted the sheep of the class because a countless many fell into his laughing pit but in the end he was completely outwitted by none other than me there are 2 fairplay award recipients namely jason and anjan
both play a very good game and end up far as in as far as top 5 in class
both conceal their capabilities very well playing the im a doofus dont worry about me role
what i know is that they definitely go home to mug their heads off
personally i fell into anjans trap at the start of the year i thought he was a lazy pig who would couch up and do nothing at home
however sad for him the nurse john from above entirely spoiled his game
i got a lot of feed about him right before the exams and i marked him on my list as a competitor
jason because of my past experience with him i knew his bloody game plan
sitting next to ashok and anjan i knew i had no choice i had to step up my game or be eaten alive
i used to be a kelly w having no game plan but to win win and win all the bloody immunities
i knew that once i lost my grip i would go right then right there
i slowly converted into a neleh i let myself be used as a pawn
i let the 2 believe that hey this guy is falling into my trap hes no longer a threat even though my test marks were still maintained they no longer looked there they only looked at how distracted i was all i can say is wrong move stupid stupid people i know ive still got a lot of work to do for all i know im the one being outplayed now that theyve seen through my bloody plan maybe i just need a new alliance maybe i need to be the new and biggest fairplay p
for those interested i got 4 a1s and 4 a2s that makes a total of distinctions
ok theres this friend in my om team called muthusamy
since i have nothing to talk about today i shall talk about him and my indian physics teacher
as in indian from india
you know what i mean
muthusamy is going to get the dianesurvivor 3 award
because thats exactly what he does boss people around with his big fat mouth
actually it isnt fat but its black
so anyway he is a guy that does all the slack jobs by opening his mouth to boss people around and when people stand up to him he cries
there was one particular time when the rehearsals for om were to be done in front of the viceprincipal and diane here whined about having to go for a uniform group thingy
so naturally everyone protested and yadda the case was brought to the teacher
in the midst of puberty tempers and very uncalled for tears diane revealed that what he wanted was rank and power in his uniform group
oh my heck how many people have an attendance like you
i mean i dont even go we were lucky we protested and the case was brought to the teachers because normally he would brush away protests like they were nothing and just go on doing what he wants to do
actually its pretty sad that im probably not going to do om again because i really loved the experience of staying in school till late and all the bonding through ultimately fattening foods
i have something called an obsessive compulsive disorder when it comes to turning off the lights
my mother always gets pissed at my living in darkness and she always says something about darkness making her depressed
as if she needs anything at all to make herself depressed
but anyway my thinking today revealed to me why i always had these vampire like instincts living in the dark and at one point biting others
you see ive always wanted to die like in my previous post
just get myself away from this horrid and cruel world
but then after i pass from this world where will i go in the bible we will supposedly go to heaven a place of joy
we will be there for the rest of time
just imagine yourself feeling nothing but happiness forever
knowing that this will never end
looking at it like that heaven may not be too desirable after all
and i wont even need to talk about hell
now for the vampire part
you see vampires will never leave this world
they just live and live and continue living on in this world
the only difference from heaven is that these vampires live in a changing world
a world with emotion other than joy
a world that is free for you to explore
a world that you know and if you dont will grow to know
vampires live in a world where they are free to do whatever they want without facing consequences
of course theres the downside of having to take lives
by belief vampires are servants of satan
if only i could be a vampire not under the control of satan not under the control of god
if only i could be the master of my life my free and everlasting life
singapore just broadcasted world idol and im wondering why asians could not vote
racist people anyway only the first 6 people were shown with the last 5 due next week
so here is my commentary for this weeks show
ok when the german guy came out i was like what were you thinking with that sleeveless shirt he is quite a goodlooking guy though but his song choice is really bad
uptempo songs dont usually go well with the publics taste and he will not have an audience large enough to win
for his limited english i would actually say that was good enough just not enough to win
the aussie idol had a great voice but his flamboyant style really puts me off
whats worse he picked a well known song changed the arrangement totally and destroyed the song
he was like talking melodiously creepy
for the pan arabic idol who am i to judge but anyway all i can say is that i thought her to be very brave but maybe her target audience is not huge enough to win world idol
right from one of the judges mouths funny he was reading my thoughts
the dutch idol is another super geek turned superstar
and i really like his sense of humour banking on his geekiness to give him the cool look
and this is emphasised greatly on the spectacles he was quite good but not outstanding and like i said before not outstanding means not winner
im still wondering however how he got through the second auditions when he forgot his words
i dont think american idol would have allowed him to
a law student with a big face
sy whatever you want but his voice is really good
his performance however really pitchy
i dont know if he uses english frequently but anyway not good enough to win
but anyway i dont think anyone was paying attention to his pitch problems because of his good looks
ok first things first braces oh my god simon is never going to use the phrase too young for the competition anymore
well obviously she had a lot of pitch problems and an awkward sense of volume control but like the german judge said she has a big voice and an even bigger personality
i love the personality and the dialogue between her and a few of the judges
i especially like the one where one of the judges said something about her being as bad as the polish judge and she had a look of pure horror on her face as she answered no not him hahaha
thats all for today ill bring you more next week
yep i was playing the sims superstar yesterday and i killed 2 people well im getting a little wierd using the example of making a 70 year old couple give birth to 4 kids to tend to the farm well anyway i was getting jealous at the kids not having to go to school on alternate days without having to see a doctor well anyway im not staying in boarding school for the next semester and so my dads going to get a timer fixed in my bloody computer
i hate that so much what if i had a project that needed so much time to fix
i can see it now that big red sign you have exceeded the time limit
please call your father if you would like to request for extra time oh my gosh why cant these people just trust me but anyway on the bright side my computer can be rebooted now sorry for having nothing to write but theres a difficult challenge on survivor fire that my tribe is currently trailing in
its the june holidays and im kind of taking a little time off from my beloved blog
but anyway if theres anyone reading today will be all about the french open final between two wonderful players coria and gaudio well with all the drama and theatrics it was absolutely impossible for me to keep away from this topic
first was the loss of a set to love by a frozen gaudio
i kept my hopes alive of gaudio winning but after it reached 51 in the second set i thought it would be all over
but a spark can be relit in the presence of oxygen i thought and remembered how he climbed up from a 51 in the second against nalbandian
for a moment that seemed to be the case as he went up 53 but then he lost the set
my dad was saying that gaudio did not deserve to be there did not even deserve the challenge
my dear daddy i thought to myself in an unfair world it matters not that you deserve to be there but that you are there the crowd was all behind gaudio and he climbed back up a set 64
coria had strained a muscle and was experiencing cramps
huge drama it was when he was reduced to a snails pace and lost a set in the final set both men were exhausted and coria seemed to have recovered from his cramp
but anyway with crucial breaks at almost every turn tension was high the crowd was restless and the cheering could only be stopped by hitting a serve
all the rest was bullcrap tennis and really is not worth mentioning
gaudio won in the end after all his nervous laughter and his funny antics
with all the drama and the theatrics i believe that if i were on court that day i would win
because i for one can act
well looking at the amount of homework ive got for the june holidays i really shouldnt be calling it the june holidays anymore
in fact from now on i shall call it home school
can you believe it after the stupid sars homework being posted on the internet the school seems to have found more ecofriendly to have us print our own homework out
like i said before death iways a good option
anyway i really have nothing to write about
im basically posting for the sake of posting
so today like i said a few posts before i shall tell you about my friend chun ming
ive also said that i have no doubt my relationship with him is nothing but friendship because i knew him before my hormones started raging
he has a really really broad face even broader than mine actually
he used to be really skinny and stalky but now ive reached puberty and ive grown to be of equal height
and now hes sporting a bulging tummy that he doesnt want to bring up
really sometimes when you look at him he looks like a chinese version of barry manilow and clay aiken crossed
just that his face is growing just a little plumper
that too is something he doesnt want to bring up
obviously told by his growing body he is a a rwally bubbly person if you get my drift
his mouth can never stop complaining and talking
but unlike the jenna awardee samuel see he spouts things that actually make sense
he is a creative thinker like me and was involved in the om competitions
he has a knick for shooting off his mouth sometimes and the younger petty me got really angry with him once for letting off a secret of mine
but now he usually keeps his mouth in check
i have a wierd feeling that hell make it well in the corporate world but his stupid ambition is to be a teacher
his has however a whole list of ambitions from owning a bus company to being the head of the land transport authority
any tourists to singapore on a shoestring budget go to him for help for public transport
here is my supposedtobeunopiniated summary of the 4th leg of the race
i want to start off on a particular note the note that basically says that colin is a dirty lowdown son of a bitch
there the start to my opinionless summary
ok so the teams got the clue at the pit stop telling them to take a 20hour bus ride to buenos aires where theyll get their flights to russia
woohoo new destination anyway the teams arrived at the bus station one by one and everything was closed
they agreed that they would get their tickets in the order to arrive but when colin christie talked to a ver sad man they found here was a bus that left 3 hours later but still arrived at the same time
the queue rearranged because of that scum of the earth
mirna pissed off a few people and drew an absolutely ucalled for dont talk to me when she tried to ask lance what was happening
the piece of shit went and bought tickets for 4 other teams because thats the order in which they were there
i didnt see any queue the four behind teams rushed to the airport where charla mirna standbyed on a swiss air flight
i really dont know if they knew about the flight to germany at this point cause they were playing push barbie around the airport and not bothering to find another flight
the twins bowling moms worked together while bob joyce had no time to look
oooh look whos the business loser this time
bob joyce got business class seats havent they learnt from 4 previous seasons anyway everyone leaves and charla mirna are left behind
they unexpectedly catch the marshall lance flight
like i said i dont know if they knew already that there was this flight but if they did theyre the airline experts for this season
so everyone arrives in russia and they find the stupid battleship
fro the first time since the first leg we see the yield the detour block 5 shots in which the teams travel to a nearby skating ring and have to block 5 ice hockey slap shots
and drink 1 shot in which the teams had to travel further away to do this traditional drinking thing
its obvious to me that the drinking was much easier and unfair also cause charlas arms length would be too short
for some reason theres no pictures with charla looking absolutely hilarious in the ice skating outfit
they had to find a bronze horseman in the middle of st
petersburg which is a waste of time route marker cause they didnt do anything there
they were then told that they had to go the the old tower for the most exciting roadblock ever
caviar the most expensive salt there is on the market
the favourite topping for the high society table was wasted on one of the best thought roadblocks ive ever seen
1 friggin kilogram per person which makes a total of 8 kilos
now if 100 grams cost about 50 bucks 1kg wouls cost 500 and 8 would cost the producers a whopping s4000 anyway the sodium chloride imbalance in most of the eaters mentally balanced chip who finished it in monster speed
the only other guy who ate marshall could not match up but was still miserably fast
brandon and colin are idiots the best eater was charla followed by joyce
nicole fell terribly sick which shows she already has a little imbalance on the caviar side
christie did not fall as sick which means shes perfectly normal
oh what a chemically incorrect task but who cares anyway the teams all made thier way to catherines palace their pit stop
yadda and bob joyce were eliminated now the producers are going to have to pay for the huge water bills that the caviar eaters were going to drink
amazing races sports injury by ethan alter the amazing races fatherdaughter duo jim and marsha got off to the roughest start of any team
after jim took a tumble on the santa monica boardwalk and ripped up his knee they were forced to go to the hospital and nearly missed the first airline flight of the race
but they never gave up battling their way into third place on the second leg
their luck gave out tuesday night though as plane problems grounded them for good
ethan so jim hows the leg jim oh its fine now
the stitches actually popped out five minutes after we were on the airplane
at that point i was just concerned about infection so i was taking antibiotics
eventually it went away and now ive got a nice souvenir scar
marsha he doesnt have feeling in the top of his kneecap though
he never mentions that part
but thats my dad i guess
ethan im still impressed that they were able to sew your wound up so quickly
jim thats actually a funny story
the nurse was taking her time and i knew i had to get her on my side
she said i dont understand why you just cant take the next flight to uruguay
so i said you dont understand i have to get on that flight
i didnt want to tell you this but im a producer and im filming a show in uruguay
my camera crew is already on that plane
its going to cost millions and millions of dollars if we have to delay the production
and she goes what kind of show are you making is it some sort of animal show i saw a spark in her eye and said yes its an animal show
she said oh really and then ran and got another doctor and a paramedic and all three of them did the procedure together
and then she said okay you go ahead and produce your show but no running and no jumping
marsha she gave him a narcotic for pain and dad threw it away because he didnt want to have a fuzzy head
all that injury and no pain medicine i was so proud of him
we felt so victorious walking to the flight i could hear the rocky music in my head ethan settle another issue did those bowling moms lie to you marsha we still dont know
we overheard them talking to some locals but they werent discretely talking to them
it was like they were trying to lure other teams into listening and i totally fell for it
after we got to the exchange booth and no one else was there we figured they had tricked us
but then we wound up beating them to the pit stop and we thought that maybe we were just so wrapped up in the race that we misunderstood
we never confronted them about it and they probably had no hand in it
i cant wait to talk to them and say were sorry for saying such nasty things about you ethan what happened to you at the buenos aires airport that was confusing
marsha i told the woman behind the counter to book us on the 910 flight but there was only one seat left
so i had her book me on that flight and put dad on the standby list
i also asked her to confirm us for the 1030 flight
i think confusion arose because brandon and nicole whom i never should have helped in the first place after they screwed us over on the first leg asked us to buy their tickets too
so now im asking for a lot of tickets and i guess the lady got confused
in her mind she said well marshas got a ticket for the 910 so ill put jim and brandon and nicole on the 1030
so i think were set and then dad sees that i dont have a ticket for the 1030 flight
jim she made the mistake of not giving us the tickets that we asked for and i made the mistake of not checking the tickets at the counter
once we got back to the counter and realized she wasnt going to admit her mistake we got the airport manager in on it and even she couldnt do anything
but we still didnt think we were sunk because we were first on the standby list for the 1030 flight
so we get to the gate and they start calling out all the standby passengers except us
we asked what was going on and the guy didnt even look at us
it was very apparent that we were not getting on that plane
he took kami and karli ahead of us even though we were first on the list
i dont know how that happened
they may have done something behind the scenes that we didnt see
marsha or maybe he just thought blonds were cuter than brunets
laughs ethan you got on the 1130 plane instead
did you have any hope of catching up marsha the episode didnt indicate this but our plane was actually delayed for another 30 minutes
once we landed we ran a really quick race
if it wasnt for those 30 minutes i think we could have caught up to marshall and lance
the producers even told us later that we were really close to beating those guys
that title is entirely random and hysterical
but anyway this is my comments on each individual team on the third leg of the race with teams showing their flight arrangement skills for the first time
the first leg isnt counted cause the flight arrangements were printewd on their route infos
colin christie a first place finish was entirely unearned
they were featured much more this time than in the previous episodes and we all saw that theres really nothing much to them
theyre only first because of their ability if you can even consider it an ability to outrun charla
there will come a point in the race where the team will face some immense difficulty and this team will crumble because of chrisies inability to keep calm and be nice
colin is a great racer with his ability to keep calm and his classy aggressiveness in getting his plane tickets
christie on the other hand will do nothing except to bring the team down
charla mirna charla mirna showed that they had mental powress that could overcome a lot of physical obstacles again
they are paying for it with charla having limited choices to make in the physical tasks
i love it that theyre so aggressive but can still work well together but they need to be nicer to the other teams
i know theyre policy is to be nice to those who are nice to them but they do not need to flare up at those who arent
if they didnt flare up today i think theyll be in a good position to go very far but at this point a yeild might be the price to pay for being mean
boo mirna charla is having a hell lot of fun in the race except the part where she turned into a chocolate loving frankenstein after getting electrocuted
its sad that they made an alliance with people they cannot trust
they really need to use their yeild power now with most effect on marshall lance
brandon nicole nicole first it wasnt a smart move revealing your bond with charla mirna at the airport
i fully agree with mirna on this one
one good thing is that she has revealed herself to not be the whiny one in this race cause christie is the one that has gone miles ahead of her in this area
brandon seems to be the only one in this team taking the reins in trying to find flights doing the tasks cause hes stronger and according to him has a bigger stomach for chocolate
i have to give the team their props on getting to the 2nd flight cause i really didnt see them working
maybe it was just dumb luck
it was really despicable of this team to go leave charla mirna in the lurch like that with possibly no flight out
bob joyce im actually starting to like this team of course under a certain influence
theyve been consistent in their 4th 5th place finishes even with their lack of physicality
they werent featured much in this episode but i think they can use their age more to their advantage while getting flights
too mild to fight off the aggressive teams at the moment but sneak under the covers and be really really nice and youll get pecedence over the others when it comes to this area
maybe the world of internet dating isnt so bad after all
kami karli they got really lucky with the flights this week but it might just die on them next week
their characters are so similar that it is impossible to tell between the 2
didnt notice much of them this leg except for the fact that they keep bumping into chip kim everywhere
really showed their stupidity by missing the strip of shallow water leading to the island
coupled with them walking right past the cluebox last week i will safely quote my friend saying they use their legs more than their eyes
big question will they be back battling for last place with chip kim definitely yes and theyll hopefully be joined by marshall lance
linda karen karens definitely the better racer in this team
shes giving way to linda the big chicken by letting her do the easier more enjoyable tasks
linda will definitely bring the team down at some point and karen wont be able to do anything to stop it
unless karen has the angellike temperament of zach last season she will also not be able to take the heat and will collapse with exhaustion at having to give way to her much weaker teammate
chip kim back in third to last place and chip declares that theyre moving up slowly but surely
surely you realise the elimination cut off point is moving up faster than you are
chip didnt really show any of his idiotic qualities this week but im sure itll come out next week
hopefully we get to see whichever one the twins or them get to the yeild and try and kill one another
chip is such and idiot but doesnt use his meaness meaningfully like in getting his tickets
marshall lance marshall lance was the team that really deserved to go this week
i said already that i wouldnt mind and wouldnt be surprised if these 2 went
im going to say that again this week
i give them their props for getting the second flight out but that im dead attitude at the roadblock probably wouldve made 10 white chocolates go down his throat without them noticing
the guy that wasnt doing to roadblock wasnt helping
showing your frustration at you teammate is never a good idea
they are really boring and ti sure looks like they get into trouble next week
jim marsha this pair definitely couldve made it together
theyre like the nice guy team this time aroung beside bob joyce and we wouldve loved to see them go further
as much as i dont want to i have to bash them for their lack of skill in getting plane tickets
really horrid that you managed to get tickets for someone else on the flight you werent booked on
and in the whole race ive never ever heard of only one team member being booked on a flight
they stayd positive till the end and theres a plus point for them
this to me was the best episode yet with the dating couples ending their losing streak and a proper fun roadblock and an even choice for detour
the only sad thing was that the photo album is short of any good pictures
boo the editors give me the photos and ill pick out the good ones for you
ok so the teams left the pit stop in buenos aires
brandon nicole got stuck in the mud and charla mirna thinking they were friends stopped to get them help
charla in the process got electrocuted by an innocent looking fence
poor her the first betrayal charla mirna go on a different path
brandon nicole a few feet behind them dont even bother honking to warn them
at the airport brandon nicole found that all the counters were closed and they decided to try to call for information
the earliest flight at 9
the next flight they thought was at 10
everyone queued at the argetina airlines counter but marshall lance decided to go out and investigate
this i have to give them props for
unless you have no time left do not be satisfied with what you have
charla mirna followed suit and hearing that there was a 9
40 flight ran to a ticketing counter just across the hall lining before marshall lance
jim marsha helped brandon nicole get tickets which again violated nicoles promise to help charla mirna get tickets
in the end charla mirna and a very lucky colin christie without christies help got on to the 9
with that the teams made their way to bariloche argentina one by one in 4 seperate flights
they were supposed to find the mayor of the place but surprise surprise theres no picutre of him in the photo gallery
anyway from there the clue directed them to a chocolate factory
their task there was to chomp through 11000 chocolates to find 1 of 20 with a white centre
to me and a few teams this sounded like an easy almost pleasurable task
however people almost puked at the amount of chocolate they had to wolf down
i think it wouldnt have been a problem for mr
sweet tooth here but i really havent eaten that much at one go
so who knows charla proved that she was a little monster by zipping past colin to receive a clue from her dwarf friend
how cute or rather coincidental
ok so they head to a mountain thingy where they had to choose between rough riding or smooth sailing
nobody chose rough riding but it was a ride down a rough hill that is nothing scary but slow
to me the fear of falling down on a rough slope and feeling pain is much more than the fear of heights
smooth sailing required the teams to go parasailing well all the teams had fun after the parasailing was the pit stop
a little island connected to the main piece of land by a strip of shallow water
you know that kind of dreamy thing
kami karli went temporarily blind and swam across insted of walking
but other than that nothing happened
aand jim marsha were eliminated if you were wondering
amazing race exes get evil by ethan alter nbsp alison and donny its often said that time heals all wounds
apparently that maxim doesnt hold true for alison and donny the bickering couple who went from first to last during the second leg of the amazing race
in this exclusive qampa with tv guide online the estranged pair of losers air their grievances and let loose with a few wellaimed barbs
this unpleasant exchange is about as real as reality tv gets race fans
buckle your seatbelts nbsp interviewer alison why did you decide to do another reality show so soon after big brother 4 alison i got an email from cbs asking if donny and i wanted to do the amazing race together
i asked him and he said he wanted to do it
of course i wasnt going to be the one to hold him back from winning 1 million and i was also all about trying to win 1 million
so we mutually decided to do it
nbsp interviewer aside from the obvious how did the two experiences differ alison well here you had to work with teams and that sucked for me
it was a lot easier to do things on my own and do things the way i wanted to do them
during the race you have to be impulsive and quick and if you make the wrong decision or if you let someone else make the wrong decision then youre done
nbsp interviewer donny why did you agree to sign on donny pretty much just for the opportunity to travel around the world on someone elses dollar
thats something you can never pass up
neither of us had ever seen amazing race before so we didnt know what we were getting ourselves into
and most of the people on the show have been fans for life
im sure a couple of teams had diagrams in their basement of everything thats happened on every single episode
we were almost going in there blindfolded
nbsp interviewer how did you prepare for the race donny we were on the computer until four in the morning some nights doing straightup research
you could tell from the first episode that we knew what we were doing because we were the only people who actually asked which flight got there first
we did everything we possibly could to be prepared
we just tried to be overcautious at a certain point and it didnt help much
nbsp interviewer did you have a strategy going in alison we wanted me to be the brains and for him to be the physical aspect of the race
and in last nights episode we kind of switched that a little bit
donny decided to be mental as well and thats kind of where we messed up
donny the race was way easier to do than dealing with her
nbsp interviewer was it difficult to watch yourselves argue like that donny not at all
i knew exactly what to expect
alison it was difficult for me
i didnt realize that all the namecalling would be coming from his end and the things he said after the race
i didnt realize any of that would happen
that was a big shock for my friends and family too
he was somebody i had trusted and confided in and for him to say such hurtful things killed me
donny okay well dont let your tears get in the way because youre no angel
alison oh i didnt cry dont worry
nbsp interviewer i guess this brings up the relationship question
where do things stand now between the two of you donny theres no relationship whatsoever
theres no speaking terms or anything
it ended the day the race was over
alison no thats not true
i moved in with him and his family for a couple of months after the race i dont know why youre deciding to lie
things were actually fine after the race for a while
then i found out that donny was not only verbally rude to me he was cheating on me as well
so i decided to leave him
donny thats a good one but no
interviewer are you still living in the same city donny were not anywhere near each other
alison i moved like five states away actually
surprised donny silence alison he doesnt know
nbsp interviewer getting back to the race for a moment what happened with the bus to the cattle ranch that seemed to be the point where you really fell behind
donny we had no clue that there would be stops along the way
we thought firstclass bus firstclass seats it would be direct the entire way
we also thought it was the only bus that went there
the other teams that got to the bus station after us found another bus that got there faster
at the point we got on the bus we thought we were either first or last
alison i knew we were last
nbsp interviewer knowing what you know now whats one thing you would do differently if you ran the race over again alison i definitely would not go on the show with donny
it was sad because last night all my exboyfriends were calling me asking why were you ever dating him and why did you go on the show with him instead of me thats the one thing id definitely change
i wouldnt have let him think
i wouldnt let him use his brains if thats what you wanna call them
donny well your good looks got us nowhere so dont worry about it
alison hey neither did yours
donny i would take the midget instead of her
whoever the hell thought alison was a bitch look here nbsp interviewer um so
all in all are you glad you did this alison yeah im definitely glad
donny im glad i got to travel around the world with someone i hated
im still wondering why i have so much to blog about this week
so happening well anyway i will never let anyone copy outside of my presence again
if you havent already inferred someone got caught copying my work
nbsp the worst thing about it all was that the person that caught the copycat was the maths dean
16 would know that the maths dean can be one hell of a bitch
did i mention that she was a close friend of my mothers well i was relieved when my maths teacher told me i was almost called up which meant that i wasnt called up
but what happened was even worst
the maths dean made a personal call to my mom telling her to keep a closer eye on him
and you know what she told my mom he was involved in a copying case
my mom actually thought i copied in my maths test cause i was struggling with a question the day before
and ill bet shell get suspiscious should my results come out perfect
i really should get my maths teacher to clear this matter up
tell her that im getting my work copied instead of me copying
now that will solve everything cause she wont really care if i get as for everything while the rest of my class fails
i just peeked into my sisters blog actually delved into it
i really dont think she expected me to do so
i mean why would i be interested well i realised that evrything she tells us is what she tells her friends on her blog
it really doesnt say much of the complexity of her mind does it she is as easy to read as a book
and me being a literature student i can read between the lines
nbsp well theres a comment on her blog about me having nothing to say
thats just because ive been alone all these years
you always with my other sister and mum always with dad
ive never had a permanent companion
i kind of think mom sensed it
thats why till now i have a maid to take care of me
its kind of like survivor isnt it with two prominent alliances and me as the swing
nbsp i really cant believe my older sister thinks that im having problems at school
nbspdo my results show any problems somethimes people like to be left alone so shut your overly huge trap and pinch your gigantic nose cause i am not having any problems at school i really hate it that she keeps telling me about prayer and how it changes things
it seems so super artificial and hypocritical especially with your kind of situation and most of all your detestable character
nbsp i cannot get why my sis is so transparent when im so complex in character
im too complex for anyone to read me not even my parents
thinking about it i realise how i never miss her when shes gone
how i never miss anyone but my dad
could it be that im the kingshaw of this story ohh
maybe its because the girls in the family have never been too highly intellectual and im only able to mix with those people and in the case of my family only with my dad
yes the programme i was referring to is the cip i had on thursday at macritchie reserve
we had to walk 1 hour in and out of the area we were supposed to go to and it was all counted for our cip hours
how nice is that i calculated a total work time of 1
5 hours and it is clocked at 6 hours
not that im complaining but wouldnt it be better if we walked into an office to do 6 hours of proper community work then again the physical education amp aesthetics department has never been known for their efficiency
it was really more fun than work especially with the antics of the dynamic trio we know as our class teachers nbsp mrs toh was dressed much more formally than she would in class but maybe its because she wears clothes that look like a house elfs rag to class
with her age catching up on her you wouldnt be expecting her to bend down to pick up weeds would you very surprisingly she was actually sppeding up the hill to go weeding
maybe the biologically enhanced foods have something to do with it
when she actually started weeding it looked like she was tending to her garden
staying in one spot it was as if she was looking after her plot of flowers
when we were done she beamed at us and told us the huge pile in the middle of the path was hers
halfway done the hill she actually started running as in really running
to the aircon she yelled as our incredulous faces looked up at her
nbsp mr sham kind of thought he was tarazan
he was looking for all the vines hanging on trees and tried to swing on them
he really showed a wild side of himself when he joined in the tugofwar with the tree
actually i thought he lowered himself to my class level of intelligence which is not at all very high
but i tell you something
he actually has a car i mean it was pretty shocking to see a malay teacher have a car but his car wasnt even the typical malay second hand car it was a nice middleclass car
call me racist but malays are never known to be rich are they nbsp deven was the most embarassing thing ever
he was trying overly hard to be funny incorporating his little bit of physics into a weed pulling activity
he was being blatantly ridiculed by ashok and anjan but i have a feeling he really didnt know it
when i told him in his accent to apply the force on the weed he threatened to apply the force on your face i guess i dont look indian enough
or maybe my imitation was too good
after we went back to home ground to retrieve our bags ashok caught a caterpillar meant to scare mr sham
mr sham managed to a certain extent hide his fear but when deven saw it he was totally mortified
he was saved by the ranger asking ashok to put it back and later gave the lame excuse of it having the possibility of being poisonous
i was forced to buy tickets for the festival of arts
if i had to spend my time and money on something it would definitely be drama
even though i knew that the storyline had no backbone it was still better than going into a sleeping room with the music teams
my very professional comments on the performance nbsp storyline the storyline is a failure
anybody and everybody could see that
but this was meant mostly for interschool fun so the storyline doesnt exactly matter
the author of the script is definitely not a thinker
nbsp scriptdialogue amidst a sea of puns and witty comments the script wasnt exactly too smooth flowing
it was really good enough for a school performance like that just that it wasnt perfect
the witty asides are whats best in the script and this is where most of the drama club sriptwriting skills shine
for the simple and nonsensical storyline the script was almost too good
nbsp characters the characters in the script are absolutely perfect
each one represents the typical overboard ns men often talked about
the nerd the macho the on one the totally queer one the good future one and the cannot live without home one
sadly the very interesting subject of malay logic was not touched on
nbsp malays are one of the main components of army life without whom thenbspns experience is not complete
with a repetition of the nerd and the good future i really dont see why they couldnt do a dimwitted malay
super extreme cliches work well with the nonsensical storylinenbspbut incomplete experience just makes the cast a little less than perfect
nbsp entertainment value why do people watch comedies to let loose and have fun
with the flimsy storyline the entertainment value had better be up there above perfection
very much laughable but definitely not highlevel humour
after a while the humour became very much corny and overused
i still do like the parts where the actors break into absolutely ridiculous and out of point dances
their ability to incorporate a little musical influence really impressed me
it was the most highly intellectual humour in the whole script
nbsp overall rating good but not rememberable
heres the comments on the teams that i bring every reality show i watch
that is if we here at singapore arent too behind
i titled the post perky underdogs cause the underdogs seem to really be having fun on the race go the underdogs heres the whatever i promised stuff
brandon nicole i said last week that much was expected of this team but they underperformed last leg
this leg however was a totally different story
they showed no negative signs no whining and no complaining
nicole however may be a little too inactive for my liking
poor her getting shagged in a foreign country and all her boyfriend did was look for his ballspun
they got a little lucky with the cemeterys having their taxi driver correct them
charla mirna gogogogo the little one i love you charla she absolutely rocked the episode with her punk dancing her ballerina twirling and her stick your hand up the cows behind comment
it wasnt exactly fair that they got on the common ferry but who cares right it does make up for her inability to run and she paid for it again at the foot race to the pitstop
all im afraid of is that mirna will feel like shes doing everything for the team which is so untrue
i think charla helped more with the slab of beef in the first leg
nicole brandon are getting along well with them so maybe hopefully the mentioned alliance next week is them
then brandon can carry charla during a foot race ahh
i sense the first working amazing race alliance even before i see it and did you see mirnas face when she hugged phil hilarious jim marsha wowzer this team shocked me with their 3rd place finish
who would expect the weakest team last leg to come out so strong this leg
victims of the bowling moms losers ok
it was really bad of the moms to play so dirty but who would believe that a middle class country like argentina doesnt accept us currency even we in singapore accept us currency i really like it however that they finished in front of those moms
rub it in their faces people linda karen who would expect the moms to be such homebred bitches firstly theyve not heard of a foam party
and then they like those bloody cowards in class bully those weaker than them
how low can you go i really honestly hope that these 2 go down next week
who knows we may get to see charla jumping on her trampoline tummy
btw i thought the you outsmarted a cow comment was serious on their part
and i still dont know which is linda and which is karen
marshall lance who what where after a fluke showing on the first leg of the race this team proved that they teams cannot be judged on just 1 leg of the race
they are so insignificant because they are humourless and entirely serious
who was it claiming to be the ken gerard of the race again this team needs to go soon
they are of no interest to us viewers
bob joyce really really horrible leg for these 2 and they still managed to stay in
a little luck was involved of course but they could have simply told the driver evita peron and he wouldve known where to go
i have to speak in their native style
chacarita chacarita your way home soon people oops
sorry if i just cursed you
anyway really bad call with the detour
just because you like dogs doesnt mean the dogs are easier
matching the face is much easier than walking one mile colin christie same comments as last week
this team definitely has chemistry together and a lot is expected of them
however they have failed to show us any of their outstanding abilities
i really wouldnt be surprised seeing these 2 eliminated the next time
i wouldnt be too upset either theyre getting monotonous and are sinking into the depths of marshall lances oblivion
if they dont show well the next time i will have absolutely nothing left to say
chip kim chips a bastard
need i say more yes i do they sank as low as the bowling moms this time playing it absolutely dirty
i have to say though the stand off in the cab was a very smart tactical move and it was absolute fairplay even though some might not admit it
im sure that everyone rather him be nicer and let the bloody taxi go
well these 2 have got to take a taxi and go home soon cause i have a feeling next episode chip will show more of his torrid qualities that i will surely hate
kami karli poor little babes got stood up by that bloody chip
really respectable that they managed to finish the dog walking task even though they hated dogs
maybe its because theyre so catty
there seems to be a significant twist in the detours this season one is much easier than the other
theyre enemity with chip kim will push them to use the yield next episode
i hope these 2 teams will continue to battle for the last team in i can feel it
alison donny what a bummer
donnys a strong guy but maybe hes too dimwitted
alisons a weak girl but shes smart
these 2 make a really dynamic duo but queerly they were booted so early
alison confirmed shes a bitch by walking away so defiantly from her partner after getting eliminated
heres my blow by blow summary of what happened on the second leg of the race
this weeks picture album totally sucked with no pictures of the tango detour
very queerly 50 of the pictures were of the foam party at te shake placewhen on tv they only spent 5 mins there
the poster of the photographs was also crazy cause kami karli have so many pics when bob joyce have none
ok so you know they were in uruguay when they stopped
they received the clue to go to the pub shake in the uraguaian downtown
the little lady went the wrong way which i was absolutely pissed at cause brandon nicole were right there for them to follow
the bowling moms surprised me with their navigation skills as they took over alison donny to reach the pub first
meanwhile charla mirna chanced upon a hooker amazing quote at this pointsays mirna to charla about the hooker shes pissed now cause were talking to her when shes got business to do
and so the teams reached the pub one by one
brandon nicole were the ones victimised by the task with nicole getting squeezed in the context of trying to burst her beach ball
that sounds sick ok yeah she gets touched and shagged and for a moment i thought the guy was going to rape her under the foam while brandon minded his business with the balls
that sounds sick again ok
the creepy face in the picture is probably the molester
from the part house they were supposed to go to the port to take a ferry to buenos aires argentina
charla mirna missed the ferry
i mean if charla was normal theyd have missed it
manipulation the little lady actually used her disability to her advantage again
i have a feelin this is going to be the trend for as long as they are here
she is one power pack
getting the ferry to wait for the guest of honour
go the little one they got to argentina and had to go to evitas resting place
it was a cemetery called recoleta but a few teams got the wrong cemetery going to chacarita where evitas husband the president was buried
it is absolutely disrespectful of the producers to make the teams run into the cemetery like that
oh and charla mirna caught a buggy which decided it would help a little lady
amazing quote at this pointsays mirna to buggy driver little lady here little lady here and the teams received a clue for the detour
yay in tango teams had to travel 1
5 miles on any preferred mode of transport to el tango where they would receive a picture of one of the dancers
then they would have to enter in a horribly lit beautiful and atmospheric theatre where a large number of people were doint the tango
very difficult in the dim light but still easier than walking 8 unruly hounds 1 mile
that was of course in perro teams had to deal with hyper active dogs that sometimes were overly horny for their own good
only kami karli and bob joyce completed this task
amazing quote at this pointsays alison to the dog you cant keep having sex from there the teams went to a cow farm
whats it with cows this time first slaughtered bloody cows
then now its alive and fast cows
oh the irony anyway the roadblock clue read the person thats doing this task must have fast hands and fast feet
amazing quote at this pointsays charla to mirna you may have to stick your hand up the cows ass
and anyway the teams did not have to do that
all they had to do was get a bananda off the cows neck
luckily charla didnt step up to stick her hand up the cows ass cause she would have been trampled to death
all the blah and teams had to go on a horse carraige to their next pit stop
did i mention that alison and donny were eliminated what a shocker
i really dont know what to say after 2 most expected couples got eliminated first
hums away opinions and views on teams will be posted later tomorrow i kind of tired now
im pissed again that jenna i was telling you about is rally becoming the most irritating and impetuous bastard i have ever seen
samuel see boyao a mention of that very name and i feel like puking my existence out of myself
he is a friggin deperate asshole who laughs like a bloody hyena
he is such a desperate wuss that he needed a loser last year to introduce him to a loser girl
one look at his screwed up face and youll know why hes so bloody desperate
stupid low class and unhumouring idiocracy is what i will describe his life as
well hes really not as bad as the bitch of the class i will term as the deena awardee
being a secretary of the class he seems to hold more power than anybody else in the class
for some reason he doesnt dare face the class has absolutely no confidence and charisma but in front of the teachers
ooh thats a totally different story oh mr deven so and so didnt do duty yesterday
oh mrs toh can you ask them to donate 2 to the class fund wanna be responsible boy start doing your own maths homework and handing it up on time first hypocrites are those i hate the most
have i added that hes a bloody faggot he flirts with that german student in the class only because he has influence over teachers
definitely a good person for his renomination bid next year
well kid if it is a reelection bid say bye bye to your power and guess who moves in to your place haha
me no one supports your its against the school rules
in a whiny voice stand
no one ever listens to the feeble and suddenly without a teacher unauthoratative no balls allowed
who is the one who is gaining respect from everyone the social groups the uncool people the smart gang and even the ruggers me you think you got itsy bitsy control over your puny german ally i kind of think he would want me to be in your place faggot
here are the actual highlights of this leg not my opinion the first thing the teams did when thet arrived in uruguay was to find this hand on a beach
supposedly it is the last thing you see of a drowning person
whod think that you have an art form besides thosed stupid sandcastles on a beach
from the big hand the teams went into the tree area where they hunted for ferry tickets
they took a ferry to an islan and went to a meat farm to recieve their next clue
at the meat farm they found out that they had to carry a huge slab of beef to a meat shop
it was a very uncreative challenge and my favourite team charla mirna lost their lead because of the sheer physicality of it
i feel that for a team to gain a lead using their wits and then to lose it because of their disability is super unfair
boo the producers then came the detour chips or zips
chips involve the team going into a casino to play a game of roulette
the teams start off with 20 chips of which they can only use 5 at a time
they must match the number of the landing to get their next clue
my call 4 attempts of 5 chips each will take you less than 10 minutes
just bloody well try your luck for some reason there are no pics of them playing chips
zips involve teams having to cross buildings on a zipline then descend almost 20 storeys into the pool on another
that will take them about 2030 mins at my guess
might as well chips first then try the zips heres the pit stop photo which they didnt have in their photo album its different from the other photos cause its in a different section of the site
thats all with their limited photo album
but dennis erika my initial favourite team got eliminated sucks
amazing race definitely i dont see why cbs hesitated so much about bringing this season back cause from the first episode i can totally tell this seasons going to be absolutely awesome my comments on the teams
well sorry theyre up so bloody late my siss been hogging the com alison donny everybody hates me nobody likes me i thought that alison would come in with that mentality but no only her little donny is upset with her or so she thinks
overall this is a strong team even though i hate to admit it i really dont see any place where alison can lie and cheat in this game
flirting is a whole new story
maybe since flirting can only be done at the pitstops off camera she can slvage her deviled reputation
marshall lance who the hell how the hell when they reached the pitstop i was like how did they get there they played an extremely insignificant role in this episode
its either they are simply a boring team or cbs is trying to keep them low cause they win the race
if another alphamale team wins this time im not going to be too happy especially if its this boring pair that thinks theyre the jon al and ken gerard of this season
they might as well say theyre the rob brennan and chris alex since theyre the only alpha males karen linda surprise surprise the bowling moms can actually do something
do you actually belive that bowling is a sport mommies the answer to that question lies in your physical condition
they only got eliminated by a smart but to a certain extent unfair twist in the flights
i mean they probably didnt even know that the second flight arrived earlier
i really liked it that they worked together in carrying that slab of beef
they werent even tired after they completed the task
thats about the only thing rememberable that they did in this leg
bob joyce our quiet couple of this race
they are very mild and nice people
their lack in physicality i believe will bring them down in this race
they migh fluke like teri ian but i really dont think so
letting the man do everything my dear joyce is not right
you souldve help carry his backpack while he carried the beef
they remind me of an old couple in my church
the man had a stroke
charla mirna what can i say go go go the little one she said that she was here to break all stereotypes about dwarves but to me she just displayed the exact thing i expected i mean after gimlis performance in lord of the rings i kind of think everyones stereotype of a dwarf is stubborn strong headed and determined
she really impressed me with her firepower zipping around everywhere like she was a cat on a race
well she is on a race
mirnas having the hots for phil thats going to be real funny too bad that we dont get to see the 12hour intervals
brandon nicole shame on you 2
admidst high expectations these 2 surely did not perform
they got on the second flight and the twist in the flights surely saved them
everyone including myself thinks they look like a carbon copy of flo zach
they have in fact displayed traits of being flo zach
nicole started whining in this episode and it looks like she may be on her way to a number one spot that flo has taken
brandon has not displayed zachs wits and basically that will bring this team down
both models are heading for disaster with their most probable brainlesness think derek drew but im looking forward to seeing whether they can beat millie chuck in their christian proclaimations
prediction 45 place think derek drew and millie chuck
colin christie the predicted power couples are surely not performing here with brandon nicole already down these 2 went even downer
they had the flight twist to blame unlike the previous pair
i mean who would expect such a smart but evil twist i really love their charisma and chemistry together
i do think theyll go far in this race
chip kim i do not like this team
there you have it straight in the face call me racist call me anything you want i do not like this team
firstly they do not have the charisma and chemistry that the other couples have
secondly they made an absolutely stupid mistake
how can there be a task without the information booyah i absolutely did not think they would make it to the pit stop so quickly
but i really pitied them
phil shouldve just imposed a time penalty and got them over with it
kami karli they say the word manipulating in a creepy blonde way all i want to say is mostly the same as chip kim
move away girls charla and mirna are the smart ones that are going to manipulate charlas glaring disability
the question is do these bimbos do better than the himbos of last season probably not jim marsha i would love to see jim interact with marshall
imagine this hi im marshall
with jim replying really i was only a captain haha sorry im being so lame
i kind of think he named his daughter afer the word marshall
how stupid tearing your leg in the first few seconds just means this team is entirely incapable
being the first fatherdaughter team they are a huge dissappointment
dennis erika this team had the chemistry the character and the charisma
it was really sad to see that they didnt have enough aggressiveness to be in the race
it was a sad sad first bootee
it never pays to be nice in every reality show
i really thought jim marsha deserved the boot more than these 2 did but adious anyway
chip and kim mcallister married parents from coto de caza california

colin age 24 owns a cell phone store
christie age 26 is the managing partner of the longevity wellness center and the 1996 miss teen usa

according to cbs dennis broke off the engagement after erika went tandem skydiving naked with her instructor
no word on whether any peanut butter or chocolate was involved
this was actually my favourite team to win
sadly they are eliminted cause of dennis nice guy attitude
erika is so bloody stupid to lose herself a guy like this
charla faddoul and mirna hindoyan first cousins from maryland
charla age 27 and living in phoenix is married to the man of her dreams and is managercoowner of a chain of ten sportswear stores
mirna age 23 lives in towson and is an attorney who graduated from the university of maryland school of law
the two were born only a month apart in syria and emigrated to the united states when they were young children
between the two of them they speak a variety of languages including armenian turkish french and spanish and have traveled extensively to foreign countries skills that should prove valuable during the competition
this is my favourite team based on purely character
i think they have the brains to make it far but their physical disadvantage will definitely bring them down
luck luck luck go the little one by the way
doesnt she look pretty fast for her short legs i mean she was whizzing through everywhere again
jim and marsha mccoy a father and daughter from florida
jim is a 53yearold helicopter pilot who lives in jacksonville

alison irwin and donald patrick a dating couple from pennsylvania
as big brother 4 viewers are well aware the 23yearold alison managed to cheat lie flirt and backstab her way to big brother 4s final two where shewas trounced by the equally deviled jun song in the programs final houseguest voting
throughout the show viewers endured alisons incessant whining regarding whether her relationship with 21yearold boyfriend donny would still be intact after hed seen her big brother behavior
obviously the answer was yes
now we have to bear through another season watching alison cheat lie flirt and backstab only this time while she travels at least partway around the world
by the time you read this i expect you to know the greeks won euro 2004
its legendary isnt it the greeks let in the trojan horse and boom the trojans get themselves smashed
well in a way this is a literary dream come true i mean the bloody underdogs played a great move and they deserved to win
the legendary trojans went on defence closing the walls and even getting the attackers to come in and defend think ronaldo
the greeks knew they had to pull something off to win it they had to risk it
as in in the legendary story the horse was suspected and if they went ahead and burnt up the horse greeks hopes were all gone
but the greeks went for the risk and they pulled off the trojan horse trick
i mean all the similarities
oh well not really my usual length of posts
but itll do for now go greece boo the overconfident overhyped ad overrated portugal
haha today was my groups youth day presentation and i tell you
it sucked why because it was so incredibly boring and it didnt induce any strong emotion from the audience
that is what you call a horribly horrid performance and i tell you their downfall was using the most amateur instrument of modern day poetry rhyme lousy lousy lousy and they all thought it was marvellous
it is such a straightforward recitation of our thoughts that even my mom conceded it was bloody boring
why why why why didnt they just accept that laughter is always the best way to get through
why did they not accept my script because they wanted it serious
i tell you that if youre being judged by a panel that supposed to be open to all forms of presentation that thing would have been so fine but hello in front of a larger audience the one sure thing that will win all of them is their participation
what can induce them to participate clapping what can make them clap laughter next time something like this happens
fuck it off cause theyre not going to listen to the truth anyway
this team is so fucked up
recently blogging has been all the trend and on the papers its been pretty publicised
some blogs have been singled out as good and popular some of which actually mean something some of which dont
today i was unfortunate enough to chance upon one that was a diary of a tormented and life of pure idiocrasy
if you are bored and want to take a look into the blog heres the addresshttpxiaxue
i dont know what so special about her blog cause all i see is daily routine and well singapore propaganda
theres its own bit of vulgarity as well
at least here im refined enough to learn how to control my anger when theres nothing but a blank screen staring at me
how can any proper lady get so crude without any provoking factor maybe in her definition a singapore lady
here its entirely different isnt it i hate singapore i bash singapore only because unlike her i am a highly intelligent person who has prospects outside of singapore
whats even worse is that she actually generalised people coming from englishspeaking girl and boy schools like acs or mgs as those who traditionally quit the country for better opportunities
i dont know whats her bloody problem probably that she was never smart enough to get into these english speaking schools
she obviously cant see that people in these by the way top schools have enough foresight to recognise that honest and longterm success cannot be obtained by those who stay illogically loyal to their country
from my point of view even my dog makes more sense than her
im just hoping that this extreme will like her blog attract the masses the intellectual masses
ive been having problems with blogspot these few days thats why my amazing race stuff is up so late
i couldnt log in properly so i emailed the admin to find out whtas wrong
i dont know whether they did help me fix the problem but anyway its fixed now so im fine with it
anyway i realised im not posting much about my regular life anymore so since im free and not sleepy ill do that right now first lets start off with the tests
quite a few tests back over the recent weeks and i topped all of them with a bio and e maths perfect im invincible at the moment
at least since this week that is
i had a e maths test on monday on a topic i havent done with my tutor and i know that i did really horribly
then yesterday came the big blow my english test came back and i crapped
i actually failed an english test
at one point in time i remembered being regarded as an english expert
and i failed my test 2150
entirely depressing i guess it put me in place so now ive got to work even harder
im really starting to wonder how long more i can keep this up
i have a feeling im going to break soon
anyway for biology that idiotic btch kelvin chen got 2425
hes really scary cause now hes pumped to try and knock me off my top spot
i hoped he got really discouraged by my beating him when i didnt even study the night before
im wondering how i can convey that to him
i didnt even need to study to get this one and you worked so hard for a less than perfect score
any suggestions on how that message can get to him i went out with mum and dad today and if i remember correctly i ate shanghainese
my memory is horrible these days need to think before i can remember what i ate a few hours ago
on the way there there was this old caucasian man pushing his wife out of gleneagles hospital
his wife seemed to be real sick and only had her ward robes on and her flesh was poring out of it
i didnt mean to say shes fat i just wanted to show how weak and helpless she looked
anyway they seemed to be rushing to tanglin mall
i really dont know what was happening but i kind of think she was pretty much ready to go and her husband was granting her her last wish or something
its scary to think that you might be in this position a couple of years down the road
thats probably one of the reasons why i dont want to get married
s lewis once said to love at all is to be vulnerable
love anything and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken
i never want to fall in love
yes i told you that all the animal titles would be my comments on the teams
the sphinx can be counted as an animal right even though it has a human head
nevermind lets get to it shall we colin christie with a display of great wit this leg they have gained a 13 hour lead over the other teams
they however seem to lose it next leg as charla mirna steal their cab
they really deserve for their cab to be stolen after all that bickering this leg
going to travel agencies seems to be what colin does best but always remember when theres a flight thats going to go soon and you cannot afford to waste time its not always the best option
colin has a really bad attitude and instead of christie bringing down the team colin will succumb easily under pressure
i thik they have what it takes to go far most probably to the final 3 teams
charla mirna i cant make any excuses for their neglecting to check with the trusty travel agencies
like i said before the safer option is the airport
their not being able to find a taxi was stupid even though they did save a bit of cash there
finding the 50 min earlier flight out was one of the best tactical maneuvers ive seen on this season so far
i kind of think if colin christie had gotten the same tickets as everybody they wouldnt have performed as well as these 2 because they wouldve succumbed to peer pressure and went with the others to eat drink and be merry
mirna better start doing something for the team cause now it isnt exactly balanced
with 2 people o the team with an equal number of plus and minus points balance is very important
brandon nicole funny how the expected final 3 teams come in 12 and 3 this leg
of all the spoiled final 3 teams i think this one is the worst as they succumbed to peer pressure to fellowship with the other teams instead of trying to find better options
getting chip to help was it a show of manipulative powers i dont know
not much shown on this leg about them really chip kim where was kim i dont even recall her speaking in a confessional this time around
chip seems to be the brains and brawn of this team and kim is just there to fulfill the team requirement to get into the race
i kind of think that they need to start bickering a little bit to make more of an impact on the show
chip surely went up in my ratings this week
although helping people is not so much a good tactical maneuver ive said it before that id rather someone play mr
nice guy than good player
he better not help anyone if they get any further cause he may just help himself out of the race
marshall lance all i remember of them was that marshalls leg was hurt
i dont see how he got that injury unless he was so dumb that he injured himself during the 12 hour break
oh yeah he is dumb i really dont know why they didnt ask help from anyone for the rock roll thing since one of them was injured
they actually showed a little race skill by checking in with the air france office
when a team is rumored to be eliminated next round i dont think its exactly viable to support them
kami karli they really dont seem to have any brains
you know that youre more physical than the bowling moms and when you dont know where to go you might as well wait for them and then beat them at the roadblock
it was risky for them to go walking around like that without a clue as to where to go
if they werent helped out by chip i think they would be roaming the desert for 40 years
linda karen domestic airport mistake again these people never learn do they im just wondering how theyll cope next week because this week was all that was shown of them was mistake after accident and mistake after accident
again the blonde one didnt do anything and whats worse now she has an excuse to let the other one do all the work
i was hoping they didnt catch up to the 3
15pm flight to cairo because they really didnt deserve to
getting their money stripped of them was entirely deserving but what wouldve been better is that they got eliminated
anyone see dead mummies this episode
i sure did but of course since the producers were not licensed to kill they had to almost kill them by stripping them of all their cash in egypt
i mean when youre not going to be going to the airport and youre in a poor country like this how in the world are you going to get money other than being a night soil carrier so the teams left the pit stop in catherines palace and found that they had to take a train to st
there they had to find rembrandts return of the prodigal son something that sounds vaguely familiar
i kind of think i chanced upon it while doing my om research because rembrandt is one of the registered artists in the problem
so anyway chip kim took an extraordinarily long time to find the painting while colin christie started a leg of bickering by suggesting that the prodigal son was jesus
im left wondering whether god neglected to give him any sense of general knowledge
in the meantime charla mirna unlike all other teams who took cabs choochooed their way to the train station on foot
a great display of race skills was shown when she asked locals about the painting
once the teams found their painting they found that they had to go to cairo egypt for this leg of the race
chip kim stupidly rushed to the airport while colin christie a pair that has proven to be apt at flight arrangements walked to a travel agency
a travel agency is the place where they actually check all the airlines for the earliest flight
in airports their access to flight information is limited and most of the staff are too lazy to check thoroughly
kami karli were the only other team smart enough to go to a travel agency but they were too late to catch colin christies flight
colin christie came to the realization that they were on the earliest flight to egypt and the others had been duped by the lufthansa lady
they had a stopover in paris for quite a number of hours i presume since they had time to find another flight
this flight instead of 2
35 am about 12 hours earlier than expected
they got to egypt and the tower of cairo but found it closed
the poor things had to sleep in the egyptian streets
i mean even the poor egyptians dont sleep on the streets and they had to all the other teams stopped over at frankfurt except linda karen
they were found to be with the lying lufthansa lady who informed them it was possible to catch up in frankfurt
she turned out not to be lying for a second time around cause they really caught up
meanwhile in frankfurt cousins charla mirna proved that they were too small to be noticed when they isolated themselves from the other teams to find better tickets out
it turns out that there was a better flight and our little pink panthers complete with the tiptoeing scene left for the flight that landed 50 minutes earlier than the other
that scene coupled with lance stirring in his piggywiggy slumber was one of the most hilarious scenes in tar history
in cairo colin christie went up to the tower to find one of 2 fast forwards in the whole race
in a way it was a good option because there are only 2 and the likelihood of you using either would be pretty small
might as well take a rest from 1 leg of the race
they had to carry this sarcophagus one of those gold coffin thingys in the pyramids that you usually see in the movies from somewhere to a temple
colin was being a huge jerk by thinking he was so smart and not heeding christies advice
in the end christie was right and they carried the thing to the temple
at the temple christie refused to shut her gap and wanted colin to admit he was wrong
bad move i should know since my fathers a colin same name same character
when they reached the temple colin halted and started bickering
the priest started shaking his head in disapproval hey these clue holders arent supposed to display emotion well anyway i was hoping the priest tear up the clue in objection to their quarrelling in his temple but he didnt and sent colin christie along to their pit stop the sphinx
colin christie arrived at the pit stop at 11
27am and i have to fast forward 3 hours to when charla mirna arrive
they go to the tower of cairo and found that they had to go to the giza plateau and follow the yellow rocks to their next clue
they went there had a little trouble and then finally got themselves to the roadblock
from what i see this was the most time consuming thing in this leg
it might have taken even longer than the detour the roadblock one team member had to enter osiris shaft and grab a artifact bag
citing claustrophobia mirna asked charla to go down
im left wondering what mirna can do besides getting her team noticed at ticketing counters
poor little charla had to climb every single rung of the ladder because of her littleness and after a while with the bag as big as she was she had to take little rests on the ladders
those producers sure arent thinking too much about her still being in the race anyway charla mirna were given a map as their next clue coupled with the contents in the bag
puzzling for a little while they assembled the puzzle on the map and found the little hole that led them to their next location
they found the detour as other teams started arriving at the roadblock
kami karli however were easily dumfounded by the puzzle
not like they realize that the oval room in the white house doesnt have corners the detour this time involved rock roll and hump ride
in rock roll nice play on words to the producers teams had to use an ancient method of transporting wooden blocks
ball bearings in the form of logs were given beneath the stones and teams had to roll it apparently across the length of a football field
it is according to phil physically demanding but if you master the ancient art of rolling stones it can be completed quickly
in hump ride which only charla mirna arrived in time for teams has to get on horses to guide camels with carpets on their bags to a carpet merchant
this task was entirely up to the moods of the horses whether they went fast or not
i have a feeling with all those empathetic horse and camel rearers by charlas side even helping her to get on the horse they managed this task pretty fast
and all the teams went to the pit stop where the moms got last place
it isnt a big surprise as theres a fast forward
the producers wouldnt want the fast forward to determine who gets eliminated especially since theyre trying to downplay and eliminate the fast forwards
anyway next week the mummies have to beg
will they be wrapped up and sent into the tomb i dont think they would fit into one of those sarcophagus thingys
so today i got caught in ths thing that was shockingly similar to the dont talk to me from lance last episode of the amazing race
as you all know the one person i really cant stand in class is kelvin chen
with his whiny voice and incessant speaking when spoken or even not spoken to i have about this much tolerance left for him
well i dont know if hes under the impression that were actually on good terms cause he actually dared ask me for help
during recess i was casually walking to my seat when he cut right in front of me and went have you seen liwei really like lance cause i dont think he was expecting the person he hated most to talk to him
i honestly thought that dont talk to me was going to come out of my mouth but instead i just stood there for a moment and then shrugged
that just proves that the dont talk to me was uncalled for boo to marshall lance who are rumoured to go next week
thank everything on and off the earth should that happen anyway why he asked for liwei was because the estate office found out about the key
what happened was that the smartest boy in the class liwei was handed the key on friday to open the door back from the lab
he did the stupidest thing by throwing the key around and it eventually landed in the gap behing the whiteboard
now it cant come out
oh the irony that the smartest boy in class would do the most stupid thing anyway for a moment he thought he was doomed but oh my saviour kelvin turned out a duplicate key
supposedly he was afraid something like that would happen and took the key for duplication complete with yellow tag and class printed
he managed to dodge the estate for the weekend but yesterday someone returned late and the estate man took a look at the key knew it was a duplicate
control freak kelvin gets into trouble for trying to handle too many things at once
another persons in charge of the key but he with his ocd obsessive compulsive disorder about trying to be all responsible and running the class has taken over since the start of the year
how much you want to bet hell push the blame oh yeah more on class happenings
toh siew tee my bio teacher stopped me after class today and told me i got full marks for the test
and she was giving me this toothy grin that reminded me of dobby the house elf
to think kelvin chen was actually trying to surprise me by studying and attempting to hit me off the bio topspot loser i just have a feeling that the dont talk to me is going to come out of my mouth very very soon
by ethan alter theres one thing you can say for sure about bob and joyce these senior citizens definitely dont look like your typical internetdating couple
still the latest team to face philimination on cbss the amazing race tuesdays 10pmet was also one of the most popular thanks to their upbeat attitudes strong racing skills and allaround goodheartedness
here the new jersey natives reminisce about their first date and look ahead to the future
ethan so tell us the story of how you met
joyce we met through match
i had been a widow for a long time and didnt have much of a personal life
i was raising my three children and working hard
my son who is a software engineer told me mom you need a life
its the only way youll be able to do this
and i said no way
but he insisted and helped me put my profile on match
lo and behold bob came on
bob and i saw her profile
actually i passed over it several times because she looked like a girly girl and i was looking for someone who liked outdoor things
but one day i read her profile and it said she likes outdoor activities
so i sent her an email and the rest is history
joyce for our first date we had drinks at a local restaurant
afterwards bob walked me to my car and when i got in i thought yes bob i got back home that night and my daughter walked in
she knew i had had several dates on the internet and so she asked well howd this one go and i said this one went really well
joyce we knew immediately that this was going to be a longterm thing
the race just sealed it
ethan whose idea was it to apply for tar bob raising his hand i was a fan of the show and actually i was already planning to do it with my brotherinlaw
my hook was meet two brothersinlaw who actually get along
but then i met joyce and thought this will be a lot more fun
i knew she would go along with the application and i knew we were going to get picked
two widowed people who met on the internet and are active weve got a few things going
joyce and i was like i really have to do this now what in the world did i get myself in to but i would do it again in a heartbeat as long as i didnt have to eat any more caviar ethan yeah that caviar challenge looked positively brutal
joyce it was awful we had already decided that i was going to do all the eating challenges because i eat virtually anything and i do love caviar
but when i saw the amount of caviar i was shocked when i first started eating it i was like okay this is gross but i can eat it
but after a while you felt like you just had to throw up
ethan since youre both so internet savvy are you thinking of putting up your own website after the show is over bob i dont know
it would be nice to hear hey bob and joyce i took your advice and i met someone
thats part of our story
we hope we can encourage people to take a chance and get out there and try again
maybe they can be as lucky as we were
joyce i would like to do that if only to give people like us a means of support
if you are widowed or divorced it doesnt make a difference how old you are
every day is another experience
i tell my children this all the time do something every day that scares you and you always will remain fresh
bob laughed at me when i first told him that
bob i had heard to do something that scares you every once in a while not every day
joyce every day ethan knowing what you know now what would you do differently if you ran the race over again bob wed probably try to work with the other teams a little bit more
also dont always believe the information youre given
joyce definitely stay connected to the other teams more you never know what you can pick up
and the teams that are racing are very smart
its so nice to see young people with so much intuition and the absolute moxie to put themselves out there and work it
bob overall were happy with the way we ran the race
we didnt want to screw anybody over or embarrass our children or ourselves
we knew we had a life to come back to after this that was always in the back of our minds
we felt real good about doing the race the way we wanted to do it
and i think we had more fun than most people joyce because of this experience bob and i are going to backpack in greece next year
you can go anywhere in this world you dont need a tour and you dont need luggage
you can carry everything you need on your back
ethan so now that youve survived the race together have you taken the next step bob were not engaged yet but were confident that we have met the partner we want to spend the rest of our lives with
were taking it a day at a time
joyce this is for real
he knows that and i know that about him
what will follow will follow and well just take each day as it comes
i always said i dont need 1 million because 1 million is fleeting
i got the biggest prize of all i got bob
it sounds corny but its true
can you believe it i actually went to geylang yesterday cause my dad wanted to try something new and there was like the supposed food haven
it was really an experience for me cause i kept thinking of amazing race possibilities
now who said amazing race could never come back here cause theres nothing left to do we were kind of stuck trying to find an illegal carpark somewhere along the street cause there was no friggin space
my mom was wondering why people were starting to wear red shirts so early something that i really laughed hard at
its not like christmas which starts early at november mom apparently the prospect of national day parade preview had never occured to her
those cheap singaporeans are out only for the freebies who cares which day you go on ok
enough with the singapore bashing which will cease for the moment cause everyone thats feeling so patriotic will kill me
we went to this apparently famous for seafood restaurant where there seemed to be some gravy left on the cleaned table by a very generous previous patron
i sat as far away from the table as i possibly could without looking too snobbish
my usual elbows on the table were drawn uncomfortably to myself
i drank the tea which had some black dust inside
i couldnt help but to wonder whether it was cigarette dust or tea leaf residue
what are the chances of it being the former compared to the latter right i dont even want to think about it
the food was pretty good but i much rather have stayed in the comforts of my home and dapaoed something from the cze cha just down the road
it apparently also got 56 chopsticks from makansutra which was the same as the restaurant we just went to
anyway we got some of the famous tanjong rhu pao and went back to our car
on the way back we had to cross an overhead bridge
one half of the stairs leading up was occupied by creepy indian men and they all seemed so coordinated sitting on one side
it was like in that childhood story with the scary beast under the bridge that threatened to eat up anyone who tried to cross
we opted to brave the never ceasing current of cars instead
there seemed to be some soliciting going on right next to our car the indian man then proceeded to convieniently lean on our car when we were just a few metres away
i couldnt help but to pass a comment to my dad saying dad theres a pimp on your car the indian man pulled away and they carried their dealings somewhere else
i cant imagine how many deals my car must have seen through the night
anyway thats all for my experience in geylang i still have some paos left
if you ever see a random title its my opinions of the teams on each leg of the race
and its starting to take form the first one was skrewts a creature from harry potter
so if you just understood whatever the hell i just said cheers for you
heres the stuff chip kim the number one placing is very much undeserved
they have shown before that they are incapable of making flight arrangements
this week they got lucky because colin went all out to help everyone but mirna
the thing is you cant depend on someone every leg and you wont be number one on the finishing line just because you can eat caviar
colin christie i think they are one of the most strategic players to ever be in this game
they along with brandon nicole see charla mirna as threats and decided it would be best to try and bring them down
i really dont like colins dirty play but its a really smart strategic move to try and get charla mirna out early
really really bad choice getting a girl to eat when theres a guy in the team
guys are always stronger at these eating things just look at fear factor christies emerging as really bitchy
i know youre all frustrated at having to eat salt but no need to take it out on your boyfriend and another team marshall lance same thing as chip kim
these two got lucky with colin playing dirty
youre just pawns in his game so watch out
i thought the dont talk to me comment at the bus station when mirna tried to ask you a question was really uncalled for
i mean mirna was actually trying to be nice and you told her to shut her trap
as the only other guy to have eaten the caviar you really let your team down by doing it so much slower than chip
i love it when you declared to everyone when they asked whether placings were still being respected shows that youre actually thinking of ways to get ahead
from then on you just rode the colin help wagon
according to the spoilers which have been accurate so far these two go next week lets continue hoping charla mirna rock on gals these two looked to be in huge trouble this time but they managed to save themselves again
they have proved that they can survive independently without any alliances and without any help from others
i really respect them for that but a few friends wont do any harm
mirna is getting on my nerves but i like charla too much to make this team budge from my number one spot
as i said in my summary i dont know if they had secured on the connecting flight through germany or just got lucky
if they indeed secured the germany connecting flight theyre the flight supremos this season
the editors very unhelpfully forgot to tell us when the swiss air flight would arrive compared to colin christies flight
the editors might be trying to downplay them lest they stick out as the winners this season because of their superior flight arranging skills
brandon nicole i hate their strategy so badly and it doesnt seem to work
they make alliances that they know they will not keep and benefit without benefiting others
i also hate the way that they keep proclaiming to be christians
christie said something to the effect of them being christian but they will be ruthless when it comes to competition
its like saying im christian but i will not hesitate to lie cheat and steal what a hypocrite brandon they one doing all the lying to alliances states that he wants to live as an example to others so wont drink the vodka
so your living example would be to backstab whenever necessary stop contradicting yourselves and stop reminding us youre christian the fact that we know youre christian and yet see you backstab people week after week is enough linda karen queerly we didnt see much of them this episode
maybe theyre not as interesting as i initially thought they were
i actually thought they are the female versions of ken gerard but now it doesnt seem so much like it
they dont have much skills in finding flights
i mean charla mirna jumped right to the front again with their skills but you couldnt youre losing your entertainment value in this season and youre not a very proficient team at the race
your leaving would make more space for the more interesting teams to show kami karli second to last again this teams physical capabilities has pulled them through so far but their lack of brains will pull them down eventually
i really cant say much about this team cause they havent really been featured much
i admire the fact that they one doing the roadblock was shivering when she was done
it was a much better reaction than giving up and sleeping like the other prom queens
sheer grit and determination is what got her through
the comment about we hate getting pushed back already was a redundant statement
if you dont like getting pushed back do something about it bob joyce awww last week i said that i was beginning to see why my friend liked them so much
and this week they are eliminated
i did say that they werent showing much character and will need to go if they stay this boring but i didnt mean this soon joyce ate the caviar fast and she can be counted as a prom queen cause shes a skinny female
she didnt even flinch we didnt exactly see joyce finish the caviar so i kind of think the producers were kind enough to tell her that theyd already been eliminated
bobs words to her on the horse carriage sounded as if she was on her deathbed traveling around the world err i dont think i should be so mean to such a loving couple
i sincerely wish them good luck on their relationship cause they look like theyre going to be a real happy couple together
famous people are weird arent they its like theyre not real people
i just went to the craig david concert and the show was good not as good as prince mind you but i like craig david better and yes i went to that one twice on the weekend
the show was good he was good the seats were excellent
it was all in all a good night
there was some trash on parade though the outfits of some of the people were shocking not to mention the ages there was heaps of young girls and older people too
anyway what i was trying to say is that i think fame is a weird concept
we waited after the concert to see craig david come out of the backstage door and after a long wait he eventually did
it was very weird to see him in person in full view and in a normal setting walking around getting into a car
and it must be weird for him that there were hundreds of people waiting for that
i dont know what id be like if there were fans waiting for me to come out of my house every day or to go shopping even for groceries
i guess we take stuff like that for granted
i dont know how he lives but it must be well even though it would be lonely
and all those fans wanting to know things about you everything to see you and hear you
theres a bitter irony to it all
but i guess ill never know because i am not waiting to be famous i only know what its like to wait to see somebody famous
prince was also a strange thing to see
we could see his face better as he had big screens and it was also surreal
the show was much more 80s and funky and the band was great
also prince ended up being on for 2 and 12 hours but craig david was only on for 1 and 15 i think
but he has less songs
at this one the fans were too reserved and only a percentage of the crowd stood up
for the prince concert i went because my boyfriend had a ticket that a friend had bailed on but we still had a good time
he enjoyed it so much and i liked seeing him having fun dancing and singing
that was on last friday night the 24th
then the next night the 25th i worked at it and went in after with friends
it was less packed and had less of a party vibe
so i was definitely glad that i went the first night
so now am relaxed but had a big day ill write more later when i have the time
its week 12 at uni this week so i am trying to organise 12 weeks worth of notes for 3 subjects and do all the reading questions and learning
today wasnt bad considering it is my least favourite day
something good happened for a change which was good and has given me renewed confidence in myself
it started yesterday though when i got back an assignment i had worked hard on
the mark on the paper was 55
my tutor said she wanted to see me and said that it was one of the best reports she had read and that it was well written and argued
i thought to myself am i hearing this right
and told her i wasnt happy and that i wanted something to happen
i asked her if i could re do the assignment and she said shed ask
so needless to say i was pretty fired up yesterday afternoon
whilst on this fired up trippy thing i wrote email to the lecturer and course coordinator requesting to see him to talk about it
long story short i went today and got him to read it and it was remarked too
got 70 i almost fell off my seat the moral of the story is that if you know yourself then no one can tell you otherwise
i knew i was capable of more than a 55 i usually get average marks like 70 and in this case i knew it was worth about that
just in case anyone is wondering
no one probably reads this anyway but to put my mind at ease
i didnt end up going out on the day of my birthday which i said i was in my last blog before todays bloggs
because none of my friends could make it i ended up going out with my boyfriend and we saw lara croft tombraider and ate vietnamese in george st
it was a nice date and funny cause earlier on in the day a work friend had presented me with this huge buinch of flowers the most beautiful romantic flowers ever two bunches of light and dark pink tiger striped lilys with green leafy stalks
shes a close girlfriend too and wherever we went that night all the women everywhere would look at the flowers drool and sigh and then look at my boyfriend as if he was the most lovely guy ever hehehe it was funny there was one point in the evening when i had to go to the bathroom after the movie and left boyfriend holding the flowers outside the toilets and this girl approached him when i was inside and gushed over the flowers and him heheh
but last night was a nice surprise
it was about a week since the actual birthday and last night went to the pub with school friends as my friends from work couldnt make it
but they surprised me and turned up and it was great they are the best and the presents they got me are so nice i love them
so thats how my birthday panned out
not that anyone is reading this
went out for my birthday last night with friends from school and ended up at this break beat djs set afterward
didnt get home til about 4am and woke up at 9ish
they asked me what i wanted for my birthday and they got me 2 cds which i requested and this make up bag thing too for my pending trip overseas at the end of the year
its pretty cool its a surf brand one
but its just not really my style
but it is the thought that counts
i was supposed to clean my room and study today but as you can imagine i am sleep deprived and lying around falling asleep everywhere
its been a busy week
i got a lot done i got my haircut and my nails done too so i feel pretty special
also went to gym twice worked two days and attended all classes tutorials and had my final commerce presentation ever
and handed in a 3000pg group report
yay going to rest now
i feel like a zombie
going to bed have a long day tomorrow
working in the city then meeting some new friends from uni for drinks in the evening
i am looking forward to it very much
my birthday is coming up 23 and i am feeling very bah humbug about it
i dont really want to be older i want to stay as i am because i know that i am unprepared
coinciding with my birthday is the return of uni and i know that it will be busy
theres so much going on in my life right now that sometimes i feel like i cant breathe
i went to the john mayer concert on the weekend and in amongst the crowd it was a sold out event it was strange that i experienced the physicality of what emotionally and spiritually i have been feeling for awhile
i felt cramped in hot like my skin couldnt breathe and just weary overall
but it was the best concert i have been to to date
if anyone is wondering when i say there i mean that place that you thought you would be in when you were little and wanted to be grown up
but do you ever get there and what is it is it finishing high school finishing uni getting into a relationship im 23 and i always thought my life would be different to what it is now
i always thought i would have done so much by now yet sometimes i feel like ive done nothing
when will i get there when i was away in kl my cous said a funny thing
she was talking about her future she has youth on her side and all the things she would have acheived by the time she was 25
a house a car a high paying job
i laughed at her and told her what the world really was like that i was 23 going on 24 and had no house a junky car and two lowly paying jobs and no chance of getting them by the time i hit 25
she looked at me in disbelief as if i was lying to her and i didnt know what to say
they were so important to her i guess that was her it her getting there was it
i know that those things arent important maybe if i had them already i would think so but i would rather not have them and enjoy life as it is for now than wish for something that is far away in the future
i am dying to get away from this place and see the world
more than just asia id like to travel to europe africa and america to see what its like there
here especially where my parents live its a suburban existence
i go to the local malls and feel out of place because i dont have a pram with babies in it
two friends of mine got married last year and that scares me so much
lots of other people have asked me why but to me its crystal clear marriage is cutting yourself off from discovering things in this world and entering into the suburban part of your life
when youre married theres more than just you and you sort of disappear into that
for me at this stage i think thats it not getting caught up in the suburban existence id rather be doing something life changing for myself that i want
before that suburban existence husband house and kids i want to be a traveller and have my own experiences and discoveries away from everything that is here and that i have always been used to
hihi basically i have to write something because i have been soooo darned lazy these past few months and my friend emailed me to say shed be checking how boring sorry charmaine she just told me she wouldnt be back for another 18 months which i suspected because i think that london might be a little like kl it sounds really fun and a lot of people that go there spend a longer time there than they thought they would
my unlce spent 12 yrs there and he was supposed to study only plus its good money and travel prospects everything being so close and all
so this is essential to our keeping in touch
the last few months ok three i think have gone past very quickly
ive been away from sydney and my life here for 9 weeks and it felt so goood
i love travelling and seeing new things
coming back has been a little hard actually because it means i have to do things and get back on the ball
just litle things like the pile of mail were hard to deal with i open it look at it then put it back down
have become really lazy and non correspondive i know its not a word but ya know
but the good news is that things are happening slowly
i have cleaned out my wardrobe and am proud to say i am up to date i threw away so much stuff i was ruthless on the return journey i got sick and got a cold so thats also why i havent been doing anything the cold got pretty bad and i just lay in bed for a couple of days with jet lag and the fluey cold feeling of fuzziness
then it turned into a bronchial cough which i still have at times
but about kl i love it
thats where i went and spent my time with my family aunties and cousins and uncles
the shopping is awesome and the food is also great
its like they are more on par with america in some ways just the franchise chain stores they have there are really american like hot dogs pretzels we have those here i know and others they had this one where you could get a pizza flavoured crepe or banana peanut butter crepe all folded over and it was great really crispy also the supermarkets are huge and the mallssssssss but the funny thing is my cousins seem to be at that age puberty all between 1020 where they think they are doing everything right but they are really just being strange and silly and jay and i saw straight through them dont know if its about the down to earthness of australia or just my family
being back is a little tiring cause i know that its back to the daily grind wish i could escape and run away havent worked much at all both my workplaces seem to not have any work its quite at tt and dm has already rostered everything up until march so have been trying to fill the 3 days i have off per week this session
by chance got a job interview tomorrow with the firm my cousin is presently working for so feeling abit nervous about it
its a law firm so i am not exactly feeling confident
and uni is finishing soon 6 mths and then who knows
its just for more rounded work experience than customer service is all
anyway thats all for now sorry its so boring hehehehe catch up more soon
does this count as a hobby i have decided that i am going to become a person who has many hobbies
ive been feeling a little 2d lately partly cause a new friend asked me if i had an online journal and i thought i did but after visiting his mine seems so
i dont know if i want to show this to him
his site was pretty good it had all the interests and recent things that had happened to him
and it got me thinking what are my interests what are my hobbies i guess i just never thought about it before
that may sound sad but when i asked my brother if he thought i had any hobbies he flatly replied your hobbies are friends and work
boring theres so much to me than that isnt there music concerts books games and friends and work i guess
well i guess going to concerts was a bit of a habit last year and im sure it will be too this year
last year i saw groove armada john mayer michelle branch and not really my choice but circumstancial attendance prince shaggy and craig david
i guess thats somewhat attached to work though so does that make it a hobby still and i went to tropfest last week which was excellent it was a big thing in the domain where they showed short films and everyone brought picnics with wine cheese and other miscellaneous picnic food
it was great lounging around watching the short films
so i guess i do have hobbies and interests just dont have a site about it
i had a great weekend
bianca is back from moree and there are lots of social activities happening drinks friday night got very trashed and sent out some drunkend sms and took p d formerly p t who is still a little upset to meet my friend peter at his work
i was a little trashed on the way home ate 3 burgers thats so gross and so began a bad spell of late night eating binges
stayed over in the city went home the next day and that night went to the john mayer concert at the entertainment centre
it was the best thing ever i love john mayer and so do alot of other girls and women
but the lyrics they are the best
and i wish i had written down his set so i could remember it better i was so scared id forget about it when i was watching him
we had excellent seats mine was directly in front of him first elevation entertainment centre
i bought the live cd any given thursday and a sticker for my brother
a friend of mine surprised me with a ticket it was so lovely
but we went for supper after bad and had korean which was good but i didnt get home till about 2 then had to get up to work at brookvale the next day
i have been floating around with a sea of john mayer lyrics in my head all day
if only my life was more like 1983 whatever happened to my whatever happened to my whatever happened to my lunchbox when came the day that it got thrown away and dont you think i should have had some say in that decision
he also talked quite a bit
i really like him he has a funny sense of humor and this way about him that is familiar
he was doing an impersonation of his mother it was so funny
you can tell that hes really clever and witty
want to go to new york to see the city he lives in if it has the same vibe
and want to try to explore some more music
time has flown i have done so many things in the past few weeks dont know where to start
well i got the job at the law firm and am there 3 days part time helping them out answering phones and photocopying filing etc
mail run in the afternoons after lunch
its easy work sometimes hectic and the ladies are really nice its actually an all female office and one man
they are all malaysian chinese which is funny cause i have never worked in that kind of environment but only had dinner parties family things in that type of environment
lorraine one of the solicitors brought in curry puffs the other day and they were so nice and florence is from hk she is always going for milk tea and they always buy me one but have been really tired the past week cause ticketek has been pretty busy
poor dave i have been no picnic this week
last weekend i worked all weekend and this weekend i also worked the easter show is on at the moment and its been pretty hectic i have been supervising lately so its a bit nerve wracking having people actually look to you for advice all the time
but today i went out with brian deepa katie and carol brians flatmates
they are so funny and carol had never seen the opera house or harbour bridge so i made us go there she liked it
we had dinner at darling harbour and also had yum cha at chinatown in the morning
the thing is they spoke mandarin alot and it was a litte confusing i felt so left out and cant imaging how deepa felt i actually had to interrupt them and ask them what they were speaking about at dinner tonight
i felt so rude but they shouldnt have been speaking in front of us like that especially with deepa there
the fact that she came is quite refreshing that she is willing to make contact like that and go out of her comfort zone to hang out with me was so endearing
bees back from moree and its so good to see her again
we went to the easter show yesterday and it was sooo much fun
me and dave and annie and bee went on the ferris wheel and annie was so scared she was clinging to the sides and doing deep breaths with a whhoooaaahh whooaaahh and screaming hehe she is great fun
we got our faces painted i got a butterfly bee hers painted like a fairyshowgirl and annie got hers as a cat pink to match her jumper complete with black kitten nose with a splotch of glitter
ppl kept looking at us like we were strange but then smiling to themselves
i think secretly they wanted to also but didnt have the guts
going to sleep now on a last note we saw this alpaca yesterday and it was so dead to the world sleeping that it was sitting down but had its head flat on the floor in the hay conked out
i wish i had taken a snap
thats what i feel like doing for the next 9 hours
hehe regarding online journals i was speaking to my cous online last weerk and we were talking about online posting and journalling
the reason why i thought my site wasnt up to scratch is theres layers
and this is my inner journal not an outer
i should have realised by the glib trendyness of that guys journal who i secretly think is now a bit of wanker anyways that it was an outer or public journal as my cousin put it
and who has time to make a cool trendy journal for ppl to look at and say hey cool journal
sigh not a good way to start a post i know but its how im feeling right now
the interview this week i cant believe it was only this week feels like forever its sunday night and it was only 5 days ago was well it was a little odd to be honest
the first round was easy i knew that i was doing well but this second round truthfully i dont think i was that impressive
i arrived at the place a little early and like last time was surprised to find that there were others there that had been there since the morning
why am i always surprised i have no idea
i am so naive like that
they made us go into this small room and sit at tables and prepare an individual case study
mine was about car heaters and the production line and at first i had no idea what to do
i read it a couple of times to get the info into my head since it was swimming from the excitement
then as soon as it was done they made us wait before we were taken away to do interviews
there were three people that interviewed me wayne barry and a lady whose name i cant remember
i did my presentation and felt stupid doing it to be honest since it only went for about 8 mins we talked about the problem and how to fix it
and then about other things also
they asked me what my best subject was a uni wasnt quite prepared said strategic management
i should have said business in europe but i thought strategic mgmt sounded better
it was still a d and worst chemistry
andyway i felt a bit naive im this thing that hasnt been out of uni or had a real job and im speaking to these ppl that have worked with the company for almost 20 years and the lady 7 months
she commuted and said she was getting tired
said alot of ppl did it which is reassuring
the rest of my week was a real blur
wednesday i had lunch with justin and it was fine we have always gotten on well
but then on thursday i was with dave and we bumped into justin and he looked sort of surprised and he hasnt emailed me since i had sent him an email wed night
he was with a girl a pretty little girl and they looked pretty uncomfortable
i am not sure how i feel about it really i felt a bit down really but thats silly cause he knew new i had a boyfriend as did i duh it wasnt a secret
all i know is that sometimes there are ppl youve always been drawn to and i just dont want the progression of our friendship to change now that hes met my boyfriend
he could have just been really busy and not had time to email
but i dont know whether or not to contact him or wait till he contacts me
thursday night i stayed up til 2 writing my assignment presentation which is tomorrow
arghhh my last presentation for uni yay daves bday was on friday and i met him for a drink with his work friends
they are nice very australian
then dave and i went for dinner at wagamamas and we got lots of little side dishes
came home to his place he fell asleep cause he had had so many beers and i went home
we are getting along a lot better now we were fighting a lot or i was for the last couple of months somehow he was really annoying me by just being himself
i am not sure if thats ever happened to anyone else thought assume it has
although i was feeling a little down this week i am not sure why
he has been very patient and understanding through it all even though i was horrible
i bought him towels and a bathmat for his bathroom
he chose them hes getting quite good at it really
theyre really nice his little apt
is very coordinated and relaxing to be at
last night we went out with his parents theyre up from vic and it was like old times
they sure can drink though
after we saw them last night i was trying to teach dave some canto phrases
hes not bad but its so weird hearing him say things but i like it
thats all i have to babble on about this week
week 12 at uni only about 3 more till the end
chaz if your reading this hope youre doing well babe
yep thats right im invited back yahoo i have to go back on tuesday and do a presentation to the line managers
heres the paragraph from the email congratulations you have been successful in moving through to the second round of the masterfoods australianz graduate recruitment process which will be held on the week commencing monday 10th of may
we will require three hours of your time on the day highlighted below
in the first two hours you will prepare a case study to present to masterfoods line managers followed by a half hour presentation of this case study
finally we will require you for an interview to commence immediately after the conclusion of your presentation
its a bit daunting but so exciting im ready in other news nothing much else is happening except that i clumsily sprained my ankle whilst coming home from the station
i had plannned to go to bowral to see school friends but that came to an end
tonight is allys bday party i didnt know what to get her the girls all went in and got her something already didnt even ask me so i just got her this hand cream set with little gloves
i think its so cute but i dont know if she doesnt like it i guess ill give her the receipt so she can change it
i am over caring what anyone thinks if they are getting a present from me theyd better just like it
i think im good at presents unlike some ppl one yr the girls went in and got me a picnic basket i already had one so now i have two cause i didnt want to rude and say anything
and last yr i asked for cds and a toiletry bag for my upcoming trip and i got this white make up boxy thing which isnt really what i meant and now lives underneath my bathroom sink in the cupboard as a general stoage thing so i am going to have to be specific this year indeed
daves bday is coming up and i have no idea what to get him
he is so hard to buy for particularly cause i think i am running out of ideas
he needs alot of things for his apt like towels and a broom but i think getting those might be boring
hahah speaking of boring i asked him if he wanted concert tickets to the john butler trio and he said hed like towels
so i guess towels it is then
and i might take him for a nice meal
he loves king st wharf as i do his work always has these social club yes hes in the social club dos and the last one he raved on and on about but im glad that hes enjoying his work well better go do some uni work
thats right i still have uni work
i got a first round interview with mars inc
when i got the email i didnt believe it so i printed it out
when i got to the interview after a week or two of apprehension the lady narelle told us that 3900 ppl had applied and only 510 invited to attend
so now i am waiting to hear about the second round
and its killing me softly also today i met this guy from my class jian du
i have wanted to meet him for awhile but the opp never came up
i wondered about him for awhile now
eddy and i were at the unibar and i saw him and his friend sitting there and waved then went inside
after about 2 hours they came over to us to talk and had a drink with us
i thought he was from shanghai but he is from harbin even further north near russia
thats so cool i have never met someone from there
he sais it is very cold
his name is jian du
there was also another person i met today a guy also and he is from penang his name is sze yen
small world tonight has been busy even though i havent done much i caught up with bee emma and seri over the phone

its mothers day this weekend and i am unsure as to what to get my mum
i must keep up with this journal
thats the whole point of having one right i graduated last week
it was very surreal but also good to know that that part of my life is over and the next stage is here
i am ready for the next lot of learning
international studies language more nutrition who knows what the future holds
atm i am a part time paralegal and enjoying my time off
hey everyone this weekend we were very busy and weve had a lot of help from our friends
our neighbors william and marie are very sweet to us and were always doing something with them throughout the week
william works for a towing company and marie is a stay at home wife
they live with williams mom ida who is currently having chemo for her breast cancer
shes doing okay and weve been to see her a few times at the hospital when she stays there
in any case william and jeff love to play diablo 2 together and are constantly talking about the game
william came over on friday afternoon and told jeff he needed to move our car
jeff was a little confused and william said we needed to move our car next to his tow truck so he can fix our flat tire
yes our tire was flat we knew that we had a screw in the tire but we hadnt gotten around to fixing it yet
turns out there was a slow leak and so our tire was slowly loosing air
so william popped out the screw used his tire repair kit and we were all set to go
and william told us normally hed charge 45 dollars for his services but for us all he wants is jeff to deck out his necromancer on diablo 2
which jeff does happily saturday jeff and i wanted to put up our new chandelier in our stairwell
weve had this chandelier in a box in our living room for about 2 months waiting to get a ladder to hang it up with
our old one was well old
one socket was broken and it was missing all of the glass cups around the light bulbs
the house was built in the 70s and i think that was the original chandelier
needless to say we needed a new one
so we got it and it sat in its box forever
we asked around and my boss at work tammy had a ladder
we just needed to go pick it up to use
much better than buying one or renting one so we decided to go down to tammys house and pick it up
we took cinder with us because tammy had been wanting to meet the puppy
she has a puppy too so weve been swapping stories at work
we got to her house and her puppy did not like cinder but cinder was fascinated with coco
coco is a chihuahua and cinder is bigger than coco and all cinder wanted to do was play
but coco would have none of that
we laughed a lot at them while we were cleaning off the ladder
and then we tried to get the ladder into our car
we opened all the doors the windows put the seats down everything
we thought about tying it to the top of the car but thats a little dangerous
tammy graciously offered to let us use her van for the day
so we loaded the ladder up and drove back home
jeff got the chandelier up in about 2 hours
its sort of a rustic look blackened copper and clean lines no flashiness
it has brightened up the stairwell a ton
in light and in style
it makes the house seem that much more put together
its amazing what a nice light will do in the house after we dropped tammys car back off for her no cinder this time we went to tysons corner a fantastic mall in our area and bought jeff new sunday shoes
his old ones had split off from their soles and you could see his socks through the toes
so new shoes were needed we found some nice ones at a shoe store in the mall
we also got some things that i needed for primary on sunday
we also went to target to get another light for our extra bedroom so when people come to stay they have light in their room we also got a few bathroom fixtures like a towel rack and a toilet paper roll
we had dinner in a mexican cafe right near there and walked around the lake in the shopping area
when we got home jeff put together the lamp and hung the bathroom fixtures while i played with the puppy
all in all a busy and productive saturday
on sunday it was my sunbeams turn to teach sharing time which means it was my turn to teach sharing time
i was really nervous about it
our theme for the month was how can i strengthen myself and my home through faith repentance and prayer so i looked at the sharing time helps on httpwww
org and came up with one using the shield of faith and darts
see dc 27 15 17
jeff and i made fiery darts from pipe cleaners and i taped them under a few chairs in primary
for every dart i had something that could harm the faith in our houses or ourselves like youve just come home from church and your friend wants you to go to the movies with him
what should you do or youre really hungry and your mom is busy doing laundry
you want to eat lunch as soon as you can
what should you do that one got a lot of interesting responses
ranging from make something yourself to dont be so hungry in any case jeff made a shield out of a poster board and we wrote faith on it and had the kids who didnt have darts come and hold the shield and respond to the problems
it was very cute and they had some really good answers
it went really well and i was pleased about that
my sunbeam class is growing in leaps and bounds i started off with just 2 girls and i now have 4 little girls shelby 4 kennan 4 katy 3 and hannah 3 and a boy who is visiting for about a month zach 4
they keep me on my toes
their lesson this week was on i am thankful for my home
i was talking about a picture of a blossoming tree and they all piped up that it was the popcornpopping tree so we sang the song and they proceeded to talk about what type of popcorn they had at their house
it was funny but way off the topic
we got back to talking about who lives in trees and went from there
one thing that i introduced a few weeks ago as part of the lesson is selling joseph into egypt as a game
they each took turns being joseph and everyone who was left were his brothers
i was the pharaoh and the brothers sold joseph to me and then came to ask for food
it was a very cute game and we have played it every sunday for a month
who knew it would be so popular
we were able to play diablo 2 with my dad as we do every sunday
i think dad and i died about 10 times
good thing were not hardcore players or wed loose everything every time we died
we really look forward to playing every sunday with dad
sunday night we watched some of the olympics that we had taped earlier
ive been following the swimming and of course the horses
we watched the stadium jumping finals and germany won
usa came in 4th by like
i just enjoyed watching all the beautiful horses thats all for now check back frequently for updates love ya all catherine and jeff
hello all this is the first post on my blog i made to keep everyone in touch with what jeff and i are doing out here in maryland
i know we dont keep in touch as much as wed like to and i thought that this would be a good thing to let everyone know whats been going on with us
so just a quick overview and then ill get up to date
jeff and i moved out to the east coast almost exactly a year ago
although at the time we moved to virginia to a nice apartment complex called windsor at potomac vista in woodbridge
it was a cute 2 bedroom apartment on the second floor with a washer and dryer my favorite thing in that apartment
we stayed there about 8 months and then moved to maryland
why did we move well in those 8 months that we lived there jeff got a job as a systems engineer at lockheed martin httpwww
the job was in gaithersburg md and we thought it wouldnt be too bad of a commute for jeff so that we could stay where we were
boy were we wrong he had a 2 and half hour commute one way so that was 5 hours a day he spent trying to go places
we thought 5 hours driving 40 hour work week and him going to school full time was too much
we decided to buy a house because the interest rates were fantastic and we would be paying just as much with rent as a mortgage payment
so we took the plunge we used weirchrt relators and found the house we bought the very first day out looking
it was just what we were looking for
3 bedrooms 2 and a half baths with another washer and dryer
very important those washer and dryers
so on april 1 2004 we closed on the house and moved in jeff now only drives 10 minutes to work every day and is able to go home for lunch every day
so that pretty much brings us up to speed on where we are
now on to what were doing
we bought a cairn terrier puppy soon after moving to our house
we named her dogwood cinderella cinder for short
she was so sweet as a tiny puppy and now shes just so much fun
she loves people and can do all sorts of tricks
she can sit stay lay down speak and shake
the shake is adorable but she sits and lays down the best
we just celebrated our 3rd anniversary with a trip to west virginia
this summer has been nice and restful
coming up in our lives is school for jeff
hell continue at george washington university as a grad student
this will be his last full year
i continue to work at genetics and ivf httpwww
com in fairfax virigina making apointments for either infertility and prenatal genetic testing
boy have i leared a lot weve been enjoying our time here in maryland more updates to come
interesting bits in the news this morning
first off over 750 fell sick while visiting south bass island in lake erie this summer
theyre not sure what to blame it on
could it be partly because the great lakes are some of the most polluted waters in the nation you stick your hand in the cesspool you aint getting it back
its almost as bad just to breathe in the sea spray
or it could be a dirty restaurant worker who failed to wash their hands after a potty break
you see why i dont like to eat at restaurants so much anymore a pube in the food is enough to turn any stomach
in other news the porn industry may require their participants to wear protection
and it only took how many outbreaks of the clap and aids to spark this course of action well another interesting night in the olympic arena
a white man can run and fast
hats off to jeremy wariner for disproving all sports analysts and 99 of spectators who thought a white athlete would never beat a sprinter of any other color
and would you believe it a raucous night in gymnastics it seems that the crowds have gotten tired of the scores that the judges are giving
after a practically perfect vault from romanias marian dragulescu the judges almost begrudgingly gave him a 9
9 i cant remember the last time ive seen a 10 in this sport
no one in the world can vault like dragulescu
no one can stick a landing after a front triple like dragulescu
a 10 wasnt in the cards but hes supposed to be happy with a 9
9 at that point he was sitting pretty ranked 1
after his score flashed he hid the disappointment but fell on his landing on a vault that should have been a walk in the park
you tell me that he wasnt affected by his score
move to the parallel bars same story
a flawless performance by hiroyuki tomita was surpassed by a gymnast who was far less powerful and daring
on high bar alexei nemov completed an unheard of six count em folks six release moves and stuck his landing
what was his score 9
it was enough to rile up the crowd and boo the judges
it lasted for ten minutes postponing paul hamms routine until nemov stood up and urged the crowd to stop
hamms performance was nearly void of any discrepancy but in my opinion not good enough to surpass nemov which he did
hamm won the silver nemovs score was enough to send him home in 5th place
it was a malaysian judge who didnt think nemov was good enough for a medal
didnt you all know malaysia is the worlds leading producer of firstrate gymansts sure are they keep em all in a box underground and theyre planning a release in time for the 2012 games
i havent suffered a wedgie yet today
ill be posting a link to my ofoto albums courtesy of kodak soon
once i post them ill pass along the user name and password via email
i cant resist making a comment or two about svetlana khorkina the russian prima donna of gymnastics
it seems that svetlana is pretty sore about losing the allaround competition to americas carly patterson last week and has taken to vocalizing her opinions to a russian newspaper
see she feels that the judges had predetermined patterson as the winner and in her words fleeced her for the entire competition
let me take a step back
khorkina is a product of the russian sports machine
theyve churned out numerous gymnasts divers volleyball players and wrestlers among others
in a country that is too poor to support its once to be reckoned with space program they invest everything they can into their athletes and it has been paying off until recently
alexei nemov is the last man to my knowledge to win the mens allround in gymnastics for russia
alexander popov was the russian rocket in barcelona atlanta and sydney but resolved to slink out of the pool after failing to qualify for events in which hed previously been so feared in athens
rulon garder defeated the russian wrestling favorite cant think of his name but this man was a bear to win the gold medal
now dont get me wrong these are all awesome athletes
they once dominated thier respective sports but knew enough when they were defeated
i cant think of anyone who has acted as unprofessoinal and unclassy as khorkina
in sydney it was discovered that the vault had been set five centimeters too low and consequently sent khorkina crashing to her knees
my heart went out to her
she fell off the parallel bars
again my heart went out to her
in athens she fell off the bars again
guess what my heart went out to her
when patterson defeated her in the allaround competition i felt a sense of sadness as i knew that it would be khorkinas last olympics
she paraded around the appartus toting her flag draping it over the parallel bars acting like she has for the past ten years or so the russian darling slash prima donna a very fitting role
she commented that the silver medal was grand in so many words and that it was the best day of her life
yet four days later shes changing her tune and crying foul
give me a break khorkina should wait to talk smack after the olympics are over and stop falling off apparatus then maybe shed win the gold medal
anyone watching the competition can clearly see that patterson was the most mechanically correct out of the entire field
she didnt fall she didnt stumble
she deserved the gold and got it
khorkina has to realize that even though she is a sentimental favorite in the sport its not going to earn her medals
nearperfect routines sometimes arent even enough
its a different scenario than paul hamm and the korean controversy there it was the judges screwup
here it is khorkinas screw up
youre not the top dog anymore
the top dog won the gold and even if she doesnt travel to beijing to defend her title she is still the olympic champion
however feel free to come up with your own opinion
if youre going to award gold medals to sentimental favorites because you feel they should get it call popov back to the pool and give him a couple
hell i have a lot of friends give me one
oh wait thats not how youre supposed to do it somebody had better tell khorkina
just woke up a half hour ago and im ready to crawl back under the covers and snuggle with my pillows
anyone else feel the drudgery of life like a vicious neverending cycle eat sleep poop something like that im too old at 25 to live on the edge anymore and on the edge i mean spending all my money at clubs and staying out til dawn only to stumble into work still smelling like smoke and alcohol
i did that for a while
some of my friends still do that
number one i dont know where they get the money because we all make the same amount and number two it should be old to them by now
its like those 35 year olds who still try to pick up girls at the club all spiffy in thier silk shirts and tapered pants
i start a new job with fedex soon and ill be working creature of the night hours seriously
it means that ill miss all the lovely traffic down the 101 every evil morning and all the little shits coming back from nights of crazy partying
i am no so much concerned with hours as i am with making enough money to feed my belly and jess
and maybe get that guitar ive been eyeing on musicians friend for a while a squier strat all black and shiny
wonder what shift ill work when i become a doctor
i watched a show where this er surgeon had worked mids for three years
now thats just too much
im hoping that if i specialize i can sort of make my own hours
someone tell me im dreaming i dont know how this stuff works anyway anyway anyway
off to the place where i stare at a computer all day
hope this finds yall well and behaving yourself
need i say more
ah yes the summer olympics are now halfway over
ive settled into the familiar routine of watching absolutely nothing but sports for days on end until three in the morning
in about a week ill be at a loss as of what to watch for a while and then ill settle into another routine the same one that i had before the olympics
theres always stories that come out of the olympics that inspire anger satiate even
already i can think of three
not only does he have bragging rights he refuses to use them
he loves to be part of a team
he credits everyone around him for helping him succeed in a sport where its all touch and go literally
hes one of the most composed and humble athletes i have ever watched and its absolutely refreshing
he swims all yearround to give credit to everyone himself last
paul hamm is said to have won the gold medal in the mens gymnastics allaround on a judging error and that the medal should have gone to a korean gymnast
first of all shut up
paul fell onto his ass during a vault sunk all the way down to 12th place and was able to pull it together enough to medal
the fact that he did that should be enough
its always the fat assholes who like to judge our elite athletes behind a microphone as if its easy to compete at world class competition level against the best of the best
who the hell is al troutwig has he ever competed a day in his life in gymnastics and jenny thompson
ive followed her swimming career for as long as i can remember
everyone makes such a huge song and dance about how shes the worlds best teammate helping her team members to the top of the podium but has never won and individual gold medal
do they notice how fast swimmers are at this level how close the races are they speak of a second as if its an hour
jenny has balls the size of manhattan to swim competitively while shes immersed in medical school
shes also suffered heartbreak this year after losing her mother
again fat bastards behind a microphone make it so easy to judge and point out flaws rather than significance of strength and courage
id like to start a pestering squad to urge jenny to come back just one more time for beijing
then her critics will have to shut up
how many of them can swim 50 meters in under 25 seconds assholes
i love them all all shapes and colors and religions
they are beautiful talented hard working and they deserve every accolade we can give them
they also help to encourage me to work out pretty hard for two weeks out of every four years
one more question who is this chick who calls commentary during diving i have literally seen ten competitors dive into the water produce absolutely no splash and this elfie girl will say something like oh no she was short of vertical
nope there were three drops of splash that landed on the forehead of the chinese judge
anyone give me some insight you gotta love sport
current music could it be magic donna summer feeling blah ok im late
yeah and posting here since diaries
suchisthis its server is being a bitch
vicky and i headed to kristens house in the bronx for a bbq
she lived far out but it didnt matter bc we spent the night and it was worth it
vicky and i ate a lot of chicken and hot dogs
but we killed the donuts
it was great but very fullfilling lol
then soon as the hours went by we all went outside
kristens neighbors were lighting up fireworks in the middle of the street
it was cool and pretty at first but then it started to swift its position
it went in the air but then as it went down it looked like it was going to hit us
i screamed my ass off and ran around the corner
there were many coming one after another
i think they did that on purpose just to enjoy our screaming of being terrorized
kristen was just having a blast laughing at us
she was just standing there like it was no tomorrow
let her ass get burned lol ill be down the block
later that night we had a ritual
vicky and kristen were burning everything from plastic cups to pop rocks
i think kristen has a slight fetish for hot wax
she kept pouring it on her from the candles outside
i was like what is wrong with you do you know how hot that is she was like it really doesnt burn
i really worry about her
then i was feeling a little darish and told them to flash the air
they only showed thier bras
they were like well u havent done anything yet let me see you do it
i flashed the air with my feminine parts formely known as breast
then after burning half of the cups and ruining the poor cement we headed inside for the night
i was the 1st to take a shower
then as soon as i get out kris and vicky both come in the bathroom and go in the shower
im like what in the world
theyre like sharice come in with us
its gonna be fun so i get in only im already washed and half a little towel on me
it was getting soaked so you know what i said fuck it and took it off
then they started washing thier hair
vicky washed kristens and i washed vickys
ahh those are the hightlights of the night
it was the best 4th of july i ever had
you are the moon card
entering the moon we enter the intuitive and psychic realms
this is the stuff dreams are made on
and like dreams the imagery we find here may inspire us or torment us
understanding the moon requires looking within
our own bodily rhythms are echoed in this luminary that circles the earth every month and reflects the sun in its progress
listening to those rhythms may produce visions and lead you towards insight
the moon is a force that has legends attached to it
it carries with it both romance and insanity
moonlight reveals itself as an illusion and it is only those willing to work with the force of dreams that are able to withstand this reflective light
com which tarot card are you brought to you by quizilla
this one of the many things i have as an expression zone
i hope to update in this as much as possible

its too bad i cant take this on as a full time occupation cocoa the cat is in heat and wont shut up she is normally a recluse but is now very affectionate
the poor thing doesnt feel good at all

the back yard needs mowed

sis called me to let me know the counselors at school think she will be one of the top ten juniors for grades this year
go sis the girl works like a demon to maintain grades while swimming and while working
she works harder than most adults
it should be fun to watch her grow up
this is my first entry
i have long wanted to a place write down my thoughts but have never gone through with the process
today i saw an article on yahoo that talked about this web site and decided this would suit my needs just fine
today is my last monday working for this company
i am a production planner
the company is closing operations in mexico and our office located in san antonio is no longer needed
i have worked for this company for twelve years initially in laredo texas and for the last 10 years in san antonio
losing my job has me filled with anxiety
i have two children a nine year old son and a seventeen year old daughter
although my wife has a good job i am unsure of what our future will be
my daughter will be a senior in high school next year and will go to college the year after
how well pay for that i do not know
my dad worked as a lithographer and lost his job when i was the same age my daughter is now
we moved to a little town in illinois where i finished school
my senior year of high school was six weeks long
i had enough accumulated credit from the district i was in to graduate in illinois and only had to wait through a probationary period to receive a degree
knowing money was tight i never asked about going to college but rather started working
my first job was with a company in merriam kansas near where i grew up
finding myself in the same position now as dad was then is really scary
we kids never knew how difficult it was for him
on one hand i am sure all will turn out well and on the other i am consumed with guilt for failing my family
i worry about how we will survive financially and how we will give to our children the things we want to give them
i look at mom and dad today and see two people that have survived the years still waking each day happy and with a bright outlook
i know i hope i will be the same when i am their age
one of my brothers is currently searching for a job and it worries mom and dad so much i am reluctant to tell them about me
i feel so alone not sharing this but dont want to add the stress to their lives
they will probably be upset when they do learn of this but ill accept that when it comes
luckily the company is giving me a generous severance package which will keep us afloat until christmas
i have started searching for jobs here in san antonio
i will probably have to take a job outside my experience at much less money
finding work would be easier if i looked outside the city or better outside the state
i wont do that as i have promised my daughter i would not move the family before she graduated from high school
my son and i are visiting mom and dad
i have not been to their house in about a year and am overdue for a visit
it took 13 hours to drive here
mom had dinner ready when we walked through the door
spaghetti red she calls it
its pasta hamburger onion and tomato sauce seasoned with chili powder
a staple from my childhood
i came here to tell them about losing my job but find i cannot do it
my brother is still searching for work and i do not want to add to their worries
he and i went to the walmart today and after walking from the parking lot to the store he had to sit on a bench to catch his breath
his death looms just over the horizon
all the years of smoking have exacted a terrible toll and he knows it
it tragic to talk with him about the disease
my son spent most of the day with mom sorting quarters and filing them in albums
she is trying to get complete sets of the new state quarters for each grandchild
he was thrilled to be helping gram
we will be here one more day and will return home friday
i plan to leave early so i can get home and clean the air conditioner that is having trouble keeping up with the texas heat
the girls are home with all the windows open and the air turned off

when i see you on the street i loose my concentration
just the thought that we might meet creates anticipation
wont you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you wanna know
well ive been thinking about you day and night and i dont know if it will work out right but somehow i think that it just might if we try
faces come and faces go in circular rotation
something yearns within to grow beyond infatuation
wont you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you wanna know
well youve got me standing deaf and blind cause i see love as just a state of mind and who knows what it is that we might find if we try and who knows what it is that we might find if we try
were walking different directions from most people ive met
youve given me signs of affection i dont usually get
i dont want you to pledge your future the future is not yours to give
just stand there a little longer and let me watch while you leave
cause when i see you on the street i loose my concentration
and just the thought that we might meet creates anticipation
wont you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you wanna know
well ive been thinking about you day and night and i dont know if it will work out right but somehow i think that it just might if we try
somehow i think that it just might if we try

its not firday the 13th
and the bullies were suspended
but me and my friends really did have some bad luck today first we havent finished our project in english which will be submitted tomorrow my friend jerelynn and russell was left by their bus
and me and my other friends were stuck in school because of the rain
so what we all tease each other and do some crazy stuff
the only thing we did is to talk chat talk and chat the whole afternoon we were the only one left in school because its halfday
it was almost quarter to 3 so we all just recorded our voice in the radio and we dubbed all afternoon
we was so noisy that the teachers in the faculty room almost heard us
but we still talked and talked
we were getting really noisy so our school directress which we call the penguin heard us and started calling mang bhay our schools head janitor when we heard her voice me and my friends started running and we hid at the back of our schools canteen but bulaga one of our janitor in school saw us
so we all run to get our bag and head off the schools gate
i was getting my radio so i was at their back when our english teacher saw me
i acted as if i didnt heard her but i saw her furious face so i ran to catch up with my friends
we were in the gate and were trying to find some umbrellas we can use to protect our head and our uniform from the rain
then when we had a glance from our back we saw the penguin coming so even wothout umbrellas we ran in the streets with only a folder on our head
so we thought were free from bad luck but we were wrong we were all wrong when we was walking on the side of the street this f jeepney splashed a mud in our skirts the end grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
thoughts about the weekends happenings in sports ken griffey jr
of the cincinnati reds finally got homerun 500 versus the st
a lot of people have been asking well should griffey make the baseball hall of fame i dont even know why people are asking the question of course he should consider the numbers first only 20 players have ever hit 500 or more homeruns and now he is one of them
thats an elite group in my book especially being the 6th youngest player age 34 to accomplish the feat
griffey was also the youngest to get to 400 which is significant because it proves how much injuries over the last 4 years have really messed up a potential for a historic career rather than a great one
his career numbers as of now a
378 on base percentage with 2143 hits and over 1438 rbi
hes only 34 plus he was the star player of the league in which he dominated with seattle from 19931998
and he still has a good shot in the next 57 years of winning a ring maybe even this year the way cin has been playing
yeah i think the guy deserves to be in the hall
fred mcgriff on the other hand has played to long 19 years and still doesnt have 500 493 his rbi numbers are way too low for his career 1549 and hes just not as had an impact on the game compared to others that got in
on the hottest team in basbeall the tampa bay devil rays can you believe these guys have won 11 in a row i didnt even know until this morning that they won yesterday never mind 11 in a row
too bad they play in the toughest division in baseball
they are 3234 this year and 105 games behind the yankees
but hey where else can a fan feel good while saying look were only 10
5 games out of 1st place all in all just be glad that lou pinella wont have a heart attack for another 4 days
noting that milestone it also makes me cringe that the red sox are now only 6 games above the devil rays in the al east
im not panicking or at least not trying too but the sox usually make a june swoon each and every single year especially during interleague play
i think if you are a fan the things you have to focus on the most is that we now have trot and nomar back and theyre starting to play better our pitching is still better than the yankees but their offense is way superior kinda the opposite of last year between these 2 teams and the fact that if youre talking wild card that texas a good young lineup that has average pitching and anaheim a team that was my pick to go to the alcs earlier in the year but with all of these nagging injuries around the roster as well as suspect starting pitching theyll be lucky to finish 3rd in the tough al west are struggling and with the minnesota twinschicago white sox its like division 1aa compared to the other tougher division in baseball battling it out in the al central i think the sox will be ok
they just need to make sure they win each series against minnesota coming up and the yankees at the end of the month
its a marathon not a race
finally congrats to south africas retief goosen on winning his second u
open in golf on sunday
i watched and laughed as phil mickelson completely had a brain fart on the final two holes and not only lost the open but also the chance for a grand slam winnign all four major tourneys masters us open british open and the pga championships
this guy has blown more big shots than tera patrick on a glory hole video
good thing he won the masters last month otherwise all we would be talking about is how much of a choke master he is
hes still making more money than most people combined i think he will be fine
one thing all golfers must be happy with tiger woods becoming a nonfactor all of a sudden
after dominating the last few years he hasnt even been close to any of the major titles never mind winning them
he barely made the cut this time maybe tiger needs to go back to the army to train abugharib style or maybe have nike make some super golf shoes or something
ill be in cambridge tonight derek gerrys mounting the hump show at the cantab lounge on 738 mass ave near the central sq t stop
show starts 8 and is free

from fridays boston globe boston is too racist for me he said
only what guys have said he said but thats been going on ever since my dad bobby was playing baseball
i cant play like that
thats not for me brother
when it was suggested the racial climate has changed in boston bonds demurred
it aint changing he said
they built a tunnel to honor ted williams in boston
what did he imagine would be built for him nothing man he said
they dont build stuff for blacks
why does barry bonds have to go out of his way to diss my city huh im sure if he was confronted on his improper grammer for the use of the wrod aint hed probably blame that on the man too
does boston have racist undertones yes
even the red sox do the original owner tom yawkey was from tennessee and a former plantation owner
if you ever get a chance read boston heralds columnist howard bryants book shut out
great stuff about how the sox were the last team in the mlb to have a black player yankees were 2nd to last
you see we can beat them at something
that was also the famed tryout of where jackie robinson willie mays and josh gibson were on the fenway grass and someone yelled out get those niggers off the field the city itself has had a shaky history ill admit it
we had the segregation of busing in south boston during the 70s the charles stewart dibacle bill russells house getting ransacked in the burbs former celtic dee brown being confused for a bank robber in a wellesley bank when he was a rookie and of course malcolm x calling boston the most racist city in america
its still somewhat uncomfortable to minorities
ever listen to wjamn jamn 94
5 yeah its a hip hop radio station not owned or run by black people
it shows because it sucks
but the people in boston arnt that bad this isnt fucking kkktown arkansas
for every one racist moment we have had anytown ms has had probably around 20 to match it
its not like were burning crosses on lawns or having different proms for white and black students
even black boston athletes are being recieved more here than they ever have
and they feel more comfortable because of it
look at pokey reese corn rows n all hes by far the most popular player out of all of the new additions this year and thats including schilling and foulke
plus if barry had known bostons history he would have known that when the first federal census was enumerated in 1790 massachusetts was the only state in the union to record no slaves
he also said that boston doesnt build stuff for blacks where in fact the african american meeting house was built by the city in 1805 so blacks could have a church to call home because they faced minor discrimination in white churches and that was just by forcing them to the bleacher seats but hey at least the city acknowledged theyre bigots in addition to its religious and educational activities the meeting house became a place for celebrations and political and antislavery meetings including a famous speech by socalist frederick douglas
see barry we arnt so bad when it comes to racism maybe if you came here and saw for yourself how warm of a city boston is to minorites and unlike in new york city youll even get a cab from the airport you would think twice about what you said
plus we would even build something for your arrival to prove were not racist and to make you feel comfortable
youll feel right at home
did you see that god awful performance put up by the l
lakers last night phew for an elimination game 5 in the nba finals they sure bent over nicely for detroit like last comic standings ant in the u
diving teams locker room kobe might have to get used to bending over if he gets convicted during this summer
there are so many questions for the lakers
will malone retire yes is shaq coming back i think he is where will kobe be in 5 months i say hell be on the clippers
of the eagle county penal league how about phil jackson even last night while on the bench he seemed to be so exhausted from managing so many larger than life egos and diffusing various time bombs for the last 5 years
its kind of like my seeing my dad in the backyard when i was young cleaning his 9 mm while drinking cans of miller lite sitting around fantasizing about when i will finally be out of the house then looking at me and realizing that im coming back for another year
i always said the one problem with the lakers coming into this year would be their chemistry
when you looked at their roster before the season on paper and then looked at their terrible play last night no one thought they would ever be saying things after the season like yeah they picked up a hall of famer like karl malone but the lakers sure will miss robert horry
or i knew the lakers were done in january when they put 53 year old horace grant on injured reserve
all kidding aside at least those guys played together
they were part of the system they didnt try to be the star or say anything to disrupt the teams flow
even the young talent the lakers have is promising
hell guys like kareem rush and luke walton are the types of young talent you want to develop for your future
too bad they never got to shoot the ball as kobe was hogging it most of the time
kobe wasnt even doing what he does best penitrating to the hole i think kobe and shaq are done with each other
they got their rings had their moment now its time to part
i just wish reality tv pheomoneon would be the same
these lakers remind of you of every dysfuctional family that you see on cops
even during the finals they were constantly bickering yelling and blaming each other in front of the police while at the same time incoherently denying that they just finished smoking a crack pipe
gary payton sucked balls this whole year he seriously needs to retire and get back to selling pot like he did in the early 90s
they dont call him the glove for nothing cause thats where the weed was in his car
hats off to the pistons though
i took a poll on espn
com that asked who was the biggest factor for the pistons and i voted for the whole team
the coach larry brown got them to get what he was selling and they sacrificed individual glory for the ring
a real great season a real great defense and clutch offense
well this is sean caulfields new blog
i am a comedian in the boston area
if you dont know who the fuck i am check out my bio
html ill try to post something later when im done rolling a blunt
a report out of espn
com today says that ricky williams would have failed a drug test if he would has played this year serving a 4 game suspension which means hes tested positive twice before
and check out these propot quotes fyi ricky williams hasnbsphad a long bout with depression and was diagonsed with socialanxiety disordernbspso he takes paxil marijuana its just a plant nbsp nbsp marijuana is 10 times better for me than paxil he said
from dolphins head coach dave wannstedt we knew nothing about it wannstedt said
im totally surprised and shocked again
he apparently has actually gotten away with smoking weed while on the job for the last two years by drinking a masking agent that fools scientists on urine tests and forgot to take this maskingnbspsupplement this yearnbspbefore this years round of drugnbsptestshow can the dolphins be suprised this guy smokes potnbsp not only is he friends with lenny kravitz hes got dreadlocks and admires the life of bob marley
nbspnbsphave they ever watched this guy at the lunch line
nbspnbsp masking agent that he used to fool the nfl and ever since his retirement has given tons of free publicity to urine luck
nbsp that has to be one of the greatest names for a product ever nbsp
so miami dolphin running back ricky williams is retired i say
good for himnbsp i totally support him quitting a life of football just so he can spend this fallwinter in the fuji islands smoking pot out of his bong
nbsp especially since the fact that he was the best player on a team that plays my favorite team pats twice a year
although the timing is suspect i again thank ricky for waiting until antwoin smith and eddie george were signed on to other teams before he called it quits
maybe he is a closeted pats fan who knew the red sox need an outfielder since nixon will most likely be out for a loooooong time
nbsp i love gabe kapler hes a good spot guy off the bench with great athletism and of course one hell of a right hand butnbspyou you need someone who is more consistent with his bat and has been in the playoff spotlight beforenbspeven though kaplers hot right now
nbsp i recommend either this guy nbspor especially this guy
nbsp if fiinley goes to ny that could mean johnson is going right with him
the dnc is here in boston this week
nbsp my dad whos a republicannbspcop thats working 246
5 for sleep shifts commented on the chopper noise hes been hearing on his details i hope john kerry doesnt have any flashbacks about charlie nbsp nbsp nbsp
first of all whatnbspa turnaround weekend for the red soxnbsp they lose friday nights game in a fashion that they always do take the lead early relenquish it via errors and a bad starting pitching performance by schilling then fight back to tie the game in the 8th just to lose it in the 9th under the cut fastball of mariano rivera
this scenario has been happening for about 7 straight years
nbsp something ive never seen before
down 30 in saturdays tilt bronson arroyo whos pitched better than his record and has more runs unearned than a tourist at a shitty mexican hotel decides to hit alex rodriguez in the back with a changeup which if you usually want to hit somebody you do it with a fastball
pun intended arod tells arroyo to go fuck himself thanks to tivo for the mountless times ive watched this fight this weekend
nbsp varitek the catchernbsptells him to shut the fuck up
nbsp arod responds with about 11nbspfuck yous and varitek goes after arod with a bitch slapnbspand then we got ourselves a brawlnbsp varitek takes arod to the ground like hes his 11 year old brother followed by gabe kapler absolutely bubbles up tanyonnbspsturtzenbspwho was stupid in being the starting pitcher going after the most atheltically fit guy on the team whos now bleeding profusely like hes just gotten himself into a steel cage with terry funk
nbsp he has to leave the game and in the process we knock arod out of the game as well with an ejection
so we win the fight
now to win the game which it looked like they wouldnt
nbsp after fighting back to take a 43 lead in the 5th the sox proceeded to walk about every yankee hitter in the lineup and then fall down to the tune of 94 in the bottom of the inning
but this team for the first time all year shows some fightnbsp some sparknbsp they come back to get the game close at 98 followed by nomar striking out as usual
nbsp the yankees get a homerun at the bottom of the inning and it goes to 108 into the bottom of the ninth
then for the first time in a while the sox come back like they did last year
nbsp nomar and millar each get a hit a rarity in the same inning followed bynbspa bill mueller walkoff homerun off rivera in the 9th to take the 1110 victory we win the fight and the game
nbsp thats huge in for a momentum stand point
nbsp the bruins did this 2 years ago where they beat the shit out of ottawa at the time in 1st on the ice and with their fist then rolled off 10 straight wins
nbsp this is the type of game that can change things
if the sox dont fuck it up
it was really one of the more enetertaining regular season games ever in my history of watching sports
nbsp and it was a huge win for a team that needed it
nbsp now they must continue to keep winning through this 12 game road trip to convince me and the rest of red sox nation not to open up the thursday paper just for the patriots articles
nbsp speaking off good article here on the subjectnbsp httpwww
a former red sox 1b and suv accident tester mo vaughn is now in a lawsuit with former teammate and currentnbspred sox shortstop nomar garciaparra over a confidentialnbspinternet mailing listnbspthat that was alledgedly stolen by vaughns former agent which wasnbspused to solicitnbspclients for nomars hitting clinic
nbsp story here httpwww
apparently everytime someone would open up the nomar emails they would get a huge amount of popups
rave gabe kapler filling in for a hobbled manny ramirez during the last few games versus anaheim
nbsp ive always liked gabe for the athletism and occasional hot bat he brings to the team
nbsp hes the type of guy the sox usually dont have they alwaysd go for the slow yet has homerun power guys like burks and millar
nbspnbsp lets hope he continues his good play in seattle
nbsp rant manny ramirezs hamstring
nbsp is it bothering himnbsp is it a hoaxnbsp he is a robot like dick cheneynbsp i really dont care i just want the guy heathly enough for the yankee series
nbsp hes so valuable yet he at times can be so frustrating with his often puzzled behavior
nbspnbspfrancoma aint helping the situation
nbsp the type of guy freud would have a ball with
nbsp rant n rave nbsp david ortiz
nbsp what in the hell were you thinkingnbspnbsp his good play over the weekend too just demonstratesnbsphow much the red sox need him and why it was so unnessicary to throw 2 bats at umpires on the field after being ejected during fridays 42 win
nbsp ill say he will get a 57 game suspension
but the appeal will last long enough that henbspwill make at least 2 out of the 3 yankee series this weekend
nbsp rant nbsp pedro youre a funny guy
nbsp we love how you clown around in the dugout during wins
nbsp but during a blowout lossnbsp dude you just need to chill and be a bit more professional
nbsp or take some ritalin
nbsp rave nbsp a split in anaheim over the angels very key
nbsp the angels will come on during the enxt few weeks so it was important the sox came out even
nbspnbspthey should take 2 games in seattle this week even without manny
nbsp rant nbsp why havent the sox put in a claim on john olerud yetnbsp i like dave mccarty but olerud is an excellent 1b who hits for average and is a seasoned veteran
nbsp he has had a subpar season with seattle only because that team is older that the bible
nbsp he might go under retirement but still the sox need a guy like him on the team for the stretch run
nbsp rave i dont know about you but i would do a shoppach alvareznbspamp nixon deal for houstons carlos beltran any second
nbsp love ya trot but carlos beltran is a young star and youre will always be an above average player who in my mind is damaged goods at this point
nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp
great job by david ortiz and manny ramirez reppin the sox last night with 2 2 run hrs a piece in the als 94 romp over the nl
a lot of people say they should of been comvps but alfonso sorianos 3 run shot really set a tone and put the game out of reach
plus it was a huge blast over the rightfield wall in houston
i am so glad that guy doesnt play for the yankees anymore
hes actually developed patience over the plate which is scary
bud selig wants the the winning league gets the home field in the world series thing renewed
of course he does because hes stupid
not only does it devalue a winloss record for the regular season it also pins a square advantage to someone in a championship series via an exhibition game thats like giving someone the white house just because he only won the state of florida
going into stage 10 today lance armstrong is in real danger of losing the tour de france for the first time in 5 years
ive always found it ironic that in frances biggest race a country known for surrendering and pissing on people the leader and winner of the race gets a yellow shirt
i dont know why everyone outside of the usa is in a tussle over lances alleged doping
the guy had testicular cancer i think hes allowed to take steroids after getting a nut cut off if theres anything that critics should go after it should be the fact that lance has a huge speed advantage by being 23 lbs lighter for only having that one nut
the critics sure dropped the ball on that one ok ill stop
i hope randy johnson does come to the red sox not only to help them win a world series but maybe he can put a huge dent into this over population of pidgeons we have in this city
we used to have a big rat problem around here but it got taken care of because those rats evoled and grew wings
when you see 4 albino pidgeons having breakfast at 2 different dunkin donuts theyre fucking too much
pidgeons are the one of the many reasons the nra could be a fun club to be in
it would be like duck hunt except the dog would be replaced with a cat
big series coming up in anaheim this week
and they need to win more than we do so they can look more attractive to the big unit
speaking of being attractive to units a sex video shot by a former husband of baywatch blonde beauty gena lee nolin warning not work friendly httpwww
i was very impressed because its her best acting performance shes had since
wait she could never act in the first place
but she sure can play it up for the camera now theres talent gena
hey now youre an all star
well its baseballs all star break and were 86 games through the season
the sox stand at a decent 4838 clip a game ahead of the wild card over oakland and 7 games behind the yankees who i still think arnt that good
who would have guessed that the sox and cubs would be 7 games behind in their perspective divisions these teams have so much talent before the season thats like saying that jimmy fallon and nicole richie will get oscars by the end of the decade
i was at the game yesterday still pretty bummed how they lost
those umpires sucked they had a major case of we want to go homeitis
at least my dag drunkness at games percentage is still at 1
jesus has reincarnated himself as johnny damon for now
i mean look at the similaries the hair the closeness of the initals jc jd and the many miracle plays over the past 8 games
now if he can only turn the warm bud light drafts at games into good beer
roger clemens to the red sox right sounds good and look good right smack its never going to happen
randy johnson might still go to ny
but odds are hell go to anaheim if they play well in the next 12 games
the red sox in my baseball season on eas mvp baseball 2004 are 6026
im the man and so is nomar who in my season is hitting
354 with 34 hrs and 70 rbi with a
415 ncaa football 2005 comes out july 15th
madden 2005 comes out 2 weeks later
two more reasons why i dont need a girlfriend
sitting in the bleachers yesterday drunk off my ass looking at cute girls in skimpy red sox clothing the only reason to have a girlfriend
shaq to the heat thats ok aint like the celtics are going to win the division for the next 10 years anyways
a show at the cantab lounge today on 738 mass ave near central sq on the red line
its a sports show check it out
hey folks sorry i havent been posting for a while but its been a busy week for me with the july 4th holiday a great end to the fiscal year at my job which came with a nice bonus at around 4 figures fishing in falmouth playing poker and of course the drunken 6 day therapy binge i have gone through with the red sox over the last week
i havent wrote anything basically because i was physically zapped by watching all 6 of these last games versus atlanta and new york
if it wasnt for curt schilling i would probably done a charles stewart and jumped into the charles river right now
thats how frustrating it is and its only the beginning of july
as many in the nation including the reverend tim about to hang himself have witnessed over this past horrible week one has to conclude and ask do the red sox actually have a chance to be agasp competitve this year theyre now 3 games over the devil rays i cant believe i just wrote that and pretty much heading into a they have to at least win 4 out of the next 6 big homestand versus al west and wild card contenders texas and oakland
they are currently 9 games behind the ny yankees and unless a collapse by ny happens in the last 81 games which could happen as bad as the sox are playing now ny has serious issues with its starting pitching and just got over a sweep by the rival ny mets the sox will have to be thinking wild card
with the struggles and steady decline however one now has to consider do we become sellers at the trading dealine a nomar sitting on the bench during the 13 inning debacle still gives me fits and for once you could argue that nomar should have stuck it out for at least one inning so crespo should have been in the game over millar in rightfield so that cairo ball doesnt turn into a double
nomar is also not the
33030110 guy he used to be
and hes a free agent whos already rejected a 4 year 60 million dollar deal wha
hes going to the dogdgers
so why not get cesar izturis and odalis perez in return b derek lowe pretty much psyched himself out of any type of talent since rejecting his 3 year 27 million dollar deal and putting tons of pressure on himself to pitch well in his contract year
oh well derek have fun going out in the free market will walk for free food
too bad hes pitching so bad they are talking about putting him back in the bullpen
he needs a psychiatrist like i need to get laid
c and kevin millar who suprises me every time hes on the field because his career died about a year ago after hitting
220 in the last half of 2003
he just dyed his hair blond too
boy band up plus why is he the kfc spokeperson he sucks people will reject kfc now that hes promoting it
i think pokey reese would be a much better choice
so if this team doesnt get on a streak and soon these guys will be the first to go
and i think a deal should be made reguardless because this team needs a change
and too poisitive thanks to i wont sacrifice zen master and moby lookalike terry francona
thanks to the moneyballmurphys law defensive errors happen theory the red sox now make more errors than the bush administration
terrys a nice guy but hes not a good manager
aargh i told everyone they should have hired bobby valentine theyre are some good things about this year that make you still have hope
there are the sox all stars in schilling ortiz and manny
and pedro has been real optimistic in his quotes over the last few days
when things usually went this bad in the past he usually uses the my 5th grandmother got sick excuse and goes into seclusion into the dominican republic for 7 days
and they are always the patriots
one movie that made me feel good about all of this that i saw today was major league
you take away a few things from the movie like the fact that cleveland sucks charlie sheen is a great method pitcher the mystery of corbin bernsens career and that pedro serrano despite hot being able to hit a curveball and worshipping the peagan god jobu will still eventually become the president of the united states someday
the main goal of the movie though is that it basically reminds fans that if you keep the faith youll eventually get a winner
i say to sox fans just look at the bright side in that they are still 81 games left this year and thank god for the wild card and 4th place as jack byrne says in the movie were somehow still in this thing
here are some news and notes in the world o sports out of red sox injury report reports have claimed that reliever scott williamsons right forearm has swelled to twice the size of a normal forearm
why is this a problem after all it never seemed to keep popeye out of the bullpen just give him less spinach hell be fine
notes from last night tampa bay left fielder robert ficks last name means fuck in german

sports business madden nfl 2005 for all videogame entertainment systems comes out today in select locations
on a personal level i am psyched because i had terrell owens and corey dillon traded to their new teams in the 2004 madden franchises before they actually were
by the way i havent had a girlfriend in over 4 years
olympics yeah i couldnt make any jokes about it either
so nomar is gone as we all know and i say good for him and good for the red sox
he wasnt going to stay and he was acting like a bitch the last few weeks because he wasnt getting any attention and he wanted to be healthy for free agency
i called him in his hotel room just to wish him luck and thank him for all he did for the franchise sox ceo larry lucchino said last night
then i asked him hows the heel he said its great
i said great how can it be great two days ago you thought you were going to have to go on the dl
he said yeah well its great now
sox sources even alleged that garciaparra said that he wanted to make sure he was healthy at the end of the season when he would have to take a november physical as part of the free agent process
the sox and new ownership werent going to resign him and were offended when he rejected a 4yr15m dollar contract last year
so pressured to make a deal theo though we might as well get some players out of this before he leaves for free cabrera isnt a bad player and that play last night wasnt his fault thats terrys for not telling him the correct relay position
its also terrys fault that pedro wasnt in the game in the 8th inning
nomar was being a cancer in the clubhouse despite the fact the guy does play as hard as he can while in there and produces with stats
but the other players were tired with the woe is me bullshit and nomar was tired of the daily soap opera that is boston red sox nation
the problem with nomar as we are now finding out is intangibles
you never know what to get with nomar see sitting out 13 inning games versus yankees this year even though statistically and even physical talent wise he has the greater past
remember when sox and yankee fans used to debate whether jeter or nomar was better well the debate is similar to whos career will be better michael jackson and prince michael jackson early in his career was a young and hot talent
a young prospect with great dancing talent from the jackson 5 he came out solo and was winning awards
he carried on his familys tradition
he was the face of pop music making millions
all in while prince just kept the consistency turning out hit after hit being original and gaining a fan base making a movie and maybe not outselling jackson but doing enough to be a force
he was making money and being a big player in music
then mj fell off the face of the earth when he became a white pedo pop queen while prince became a jehovahs witness and still continues to make good solid albums that quietly get the job done on the charts
as chris rock said in the end
dat nigga prince won quietly with a little flair and consistency
just like prince you know hes going to come around again and again and never disappoint especially in the clutch
he was never great in terms of stats or album sales or in dancing talent when comparing prince to mj but you know what youre getting with him a true leader and gamer wholl play every game with blood and sweat all while batting
310 with 1520 hr and 8090 rbi and a
400 obp with over 100 runs scored and of course
banging hotter chicks which is true in both cases
nomar once a much better player in the field and on the plate his numbers have decreased over the years
he cant play everyday orlando cabrera can
his defense isnt what it used to be
his heel ankle and wrist are a concern
a 2 time batting champ and once hitting
325 with 30100 now hes about as good as jose valentin with a little better batting average
oh and his obp stinks partly due to his philosophy at the plate but every time nomar popped up i wanted to kick myself in the nuts
i think thats why we had to give the cubs an extra prospect
because they knew what the risks where in getting this guy
hes a head case just look at him in the plate
he was the most paranoid player in boston sports history the media gave him good press and the fans esp
kids loved him and he still thought everyone was out to get him as if he was alex jones at a republican dinner
like drew bledsoe it was time to go
time will tell if nomar will take a page ad in both the herald and globe to at the least thank the fans of boston who loved him and remembered the great times 19972000 even when frustrated this one included
he needed a change and so did we
we gave up a great shortstop but we got depth defense and some intangibles back doug mient
whatever his name is a good friend of david ortiz and is a leader
only time will tell in wins and losses and where nomar goes next whether how things will play out
i have learned never to expect anything from people
especially i never expect anything from myself
i never accomplish when there is stress
i hate people who have expactations for me they want so much from so little
im not much of an amount for anything
i cant even accomplish the task of finding myself let alone any thing else
everytime i put expactations into someone i am always more than let down
people have never fulfilled anything and i dont think they ever will when ever i think i might have found that something in that person and i am hoping that they can live up to me they let me down
i think they have done that so much i cant cry anymore
i am used to the fact that people dont care enough to let me feel ok that they have let me down they just use me and thats it
i think i have only found one person that hasnt let me down yet and i havent talked to him enough to really see what would happen
i cant seem to find myself
today was the first day of marching band
it was to say the least ok
i wish i could have slept in more but we all cant have what we want
i need to talk to mention random name here ive been thinking about something
need to talk to him
but non the less im getting back into the swing off stuff so i can ease back into the school year
although it will be weird since its the high school and all
but ill just hang out with some people maybe get a boi and have fun this year
i haventha fun in such a long time
it ill be nice to let my hair down both figurativly and literally
i have my friends and im gonna stick to them
i dont care what anybody says
they have no more the authority over me than i have over them i dont really much care if there older than me because i just dont care
i have a solid group and thats all i need
a side note i need a episode of brendan leonard
this summer has been truley boring
i have been completley antisocial
and i think that i need that
i dont need people interfereing with there problems i have enough of my own
since i havent really talked to anyone this summer i have absolulty no clue what is going on in the social realm nor do i care
marching band starts up again in 8 short days
which will completley throw off my sleeping sense
i will have to get up at 800 in teh morning and right now i am only getting up around 1100 in the morning and not going to bed until atleast 230330 in the morning
im goingto be a complete wreck the first few days
i havent came to any new conclusions recently
i havent anything to conclude
i have been completly honest with myself all this summer and i have found what i was looking for
for once i have accomplished what i set for myslelf
even with time to spare
i hope everyone else has too
because i know what its like if you dont
i really dont want to go into the high school
it seems like such a big step
plus i have gotten so used to going to the middle school that i really dont want to leave
but i guess its a change i have to make although its one i dont want to come to a conclusion about but i guess i have to
i realized something while i was reading over my posts
i actually depend on people
while i was upset with insert unmentioned person here for stupid reasons now that i look back on it
i was truley afraid that if i lost our friendship then who would that leave me to tell all my problems to and to give me a hug when i need it
nobody else really acts like that towards me
i mean yeah i have a few other friends
but they would judge me
i guess hes just one of the people i need in my life
i was shocked when i thought about it
i thought i was this miss independant no pun intended but i really am not
im glad i realized it though because maybe now i wont take the best thins in life for granted anymore
i really need another episode of brendan leonard
i better get outa here
i changed my name to rotang because it sounds so much cooler
i will not die for your government or saffer religion i choose life brandon boyd i hate the fact people try to force your beliefs on you
the whole time as a child and a teenager your supposed to be finding your self but what if you cant even see who you are
all my child hood i was never forced into religion by my parents we never attended church and i had never saw a bible
my grandparents on the other hand sent me a bible in the mail for me to read
i thought it was a pretty good story
thats all it was to me was a story
then i was shunned from the people at school because in 5th grade the only thing you really know about your self is what you belive in
all i knew was that i had nothing to believe
in 7th grade i had made a choice to myself that i would study diffrent types of religion to make sure i was affirmend in my agnostic ways
at the same time there was need of participants in the local youth org
i went for 7 or 8 months
comming to the soild conclusion i am agnostic
i had to go threw all of that just to reach a conclusion that i am havingto defend from people who were forced into it and had no choice i think its bullshit that these people can go around and say shit about my religion when they dont even have a clear mind of thir own
i am so pissed off about it
im gonna go clear my head
i get so worked up over this
geek whats your personality type brought to you by quizilla enough said
i feel good to know what i am
moral the pathetic thing that just gets in the way of everything
why people dwell on weather or not you have the idealistic morals or not
but whats the big deal
morals are something that should be so deeply engrained into your skull that you dont even think about them
and this is only if you have any in the first place
i think our morals are just as my father says a product of your enviroment you learn them from the people who are around you
you are never taught them
this summer is letting me think too much
i need another episode of brendan leonard
its horrible how much people depend on other people
they act like if someone wasnt there all the damn time they might go off the edge or something
i am fine by myself
maybe its because i never had anyone here anyways
but i dont really think that would matter
as a basic human instinct you react for yourself
not have to be right there with your hand being held
i think thats something that has done almost totally away with the human race today
and thats a very sad thing
i need to go think somemore about a few controversial topics
i still need another episode of brendan leonard
people cant survive without me
omg the game was horrible
first of all we didnt play second of all the guys didnt show up
meaning i had to brave the world and go to the game myself
o that was great fun i came to a good conclusion though
i cant stand hanging out with the girls
all they care bout are 4 things
talking about each other clothes boys and gay random things
i almost went spaztic on them tonight but saekho was there
thats not saying much but i didnt want them saying stuff bout her cause she hangs with me
evne though i already know they dig on her and shit cause of it
ive been in a good mood for a rather suspicious amount of time now
im going to the game tonight to
because we dont have to march this one
score i gotta hook ciara up with her guy
i have nothing to write
i have no clue whats wrong with me
ill write after the game
i need to be around everyone again
even though it seems like i get fed up with everyone and irritated so easily its better when i dont have to think about things
theres too much happening at home
so much drama damn communication
i hate the way i act around people
i still cant let them in to really know me
i couldnt change it if i wanted to tho
its like embeded into my brian
warning these are the people who have your back dont let them in on anything
i hate feeling like a damn robot
i regret acting like that
once again i hate the weekends
perfect youre the perfect girlfriend
which means youre rare or that you cheated p youre the kind of chick that can hang out with your boyfriends friends and be silly
you dont care about presents or about going to fancy placed
youre just happy being around your boyfriend
what kind of girlfriend are you brought to you by quizilla interesting eh i thought so
no i am not on drugs
the shades of grey have cleared my path sunny skies to stay
i need this feeling to hold me close to make it right
please dont play with me my paper heart will bleed aar if i was a toy i would think my windup key was missing
i honestly dont know what it is anymore
theres just so much and because of that i cant even focus on one thing
i know what i want out of life that i cant have
i think i am an emotionally homeless person
im sitting on the edge of your sidewalk and my can is out and thats the farthest ive gotten because i dont even have a house to call you from
the greatest prize in life is love but whats to do when you have no absolution of it i couldnt belive in love
if someone paid me a million dollars i wouldnt
its a known fact when two opposites come together it always ends in heartache
the sad thing is most experiance heartache before there even together
but you couldnt tell that person because most likley your trying to coverup the fact you have feelings for that person
and you get upset if the person does something or acts a certian way but they cant help it because they have no clue as to what their doing wrong
i wish we were all dead to the emotion of love like robots
that would just make life easier to get thru so of coarse that would never happen
cause id never do something intentionally just hurt you and ive stared at the sky and ive asked myself why youve become like an angel to me allister pain isnt planned because its always there
never goes away never show remorse
its like a ugly scar from a long time ago
even the best neosporin cant take this away
i know my ramblings dont leave you to much of a plot line but its 1000 in the morning and i just cant take much more of this
well to everyone who reads this damn thing for some reason or another ill let you in on a little secret today was very interesting
my bandmates and i had
rehersal if you want to call it that
theres no mystery to that
the only awesome thing is we dont have a
rehersal so i get to sleep in woah tomarrow is our first football game
and we gotta go all the way to that one place
conneaut that will be very interesting
i really dont have anything to say
the usual people pissed me off and thats about it
cough cough they know who they are
if they dont their even bigger jackasses then i thought
if something happens ill write later if not ill catch you after the game
i hope that when you wake up everything that youve ever wished for is dead in your arms
im not that kind of girl
especially when the prize is sumthing that i should of had from the start but the other person is
cough cough no i am not obvious
i rarely talk about my problems as people now know
i never did before why start now
in all reality i know there might be a few people who actually care and want to know
the others jut go and form a pity crowd
but ive already been thru that explanation
our bus rides are very interesting
cough cough our small group
you know what i mean
and yet again i am the only one who didnt get anything
conneaut is in 2 days
which means a hour and a half bus ride
i know who im sitting with
smile cheesy grin school starts in about 12 days
thats too soon for me
i need more time to listen to my fuck off because the world doesnt care on the back of the bus music
i need someone who cares
today the weight of the world was on my shoulders my life wasnt spared
i hoped you would come to help me out but i found you never really cared
82003 i hate people who make assumptions about me
not even half of the people i hang out with really know me
they know the shaded side of me
the front that i put up
if i really acted the way i am at home i would probably sit in the back of the class in the corner thinking of so much that it means nothing at all
people see the happy side of me and they think im depressed i would hate to see their reaction now
and to everyone who has read this or is reading it now im not a mental case
dont even think about it
i cant help it though i try to talk to people
they all just seem to depend on me to hear there problems and deal with the problems for them but if i would try to talk to someone they would just blow me off and start on some completly random subject
i think the problem isnt so much a me thing
everybody else is just way to self centered to give a damn about how i feel
and if i would be sad or angry its not like i could tell anyone because i can tell that most of it is just out of pity
i wont stoop down to that level
on the brighter side of the rainbow
tonight is our first preformance woo
i really dont want to go
i just want to sleep
i mean we march pretty good and sound pretty good
its just that this means i have to see everybody and cover my front up again
and i am not in the mood for that
i rather slip into my emo mood and sit in the dark while playing some music and think more about why i am like i am
i might go and try out for romeo and juliet
ksu is doing a production and they need a 14 yr
plus i already have more than half memorized so it wouldnt be too hard
i dread the day that school starts
ugh ill probably end up spazing out on someone or freaking out and thats never too pretty
after dad leaves i think im going to go and rest
i need to think and relax
ill write tonight when i get home
everyone is catching on to me
i have people left and right asking me about it
i didnt know i was like a book
i dont think im so confused now
i kinda thought things thru a little bit last night and today
now its just a race against time
being so selfish like that
i should have knew it would end up this way
shell try and beat me to the punch i know it
so now i am forced into making a decision i really dont want to make
about being inqusitive or not
the thing is i dont want this to turn out like another version of no doubt
i know other people dont want me to for the sake of us all but my feelings are telling me diffrent
i dont want to just let this sit back and take its coarse
i am afriad of the outcome
i need to go and stratagise
before its too late and the whole situation becomes the one that got away
today was a torment of my own hell
i havent been this confused for over a year now
and just when i think that things are beginning to look up for me
bam things just hit me like a train and i dont know what to do
i cant just tell people my confusion first of all they most likley dont care and just want some dirt to burn me with later and if they do care they have no clue of what to say or do to help me which to me is absolutly pointless
so i have to sit here completly alone and try and console myself through this before someone makes a move
i dont want anyone to make a move
i dont want to have to regret any of my actions
i dont want to be forced into a decision i dont think i can full heartily make
especially because i know how it feels and i dont want to be the reason for another broken heart
i dont think i could put either one of them through that
now how am i supposed to deal with that
if i would do anything with one they would probably just turn around and go tell the other and vice versa
and i know that that feels like an extreme kick to the chest
i wish that this would all go away
i even felt like going away to some far off place and putting thisall behind me that way they would both come out even
because neither one of them is better than the other
i cant keep this all in my head though
i might just go completly insane and up a wall if i would
and for fear of someone involved in this reading this and getting more info then what i need for them to have i cant write anything that they can take out of context
so to save myself from more of a head ache and more pain
im going to stop here
and if i can ill write later
pain is inevitalbe misery is optional
well band camp was last week
as i like to call it hell week
school is in 16 days and counting
i really dont want to go
itll be cool to be with all the guys again and stuff but i dont want to deal with the other people
that is going to suck
i am really really really confused again
thats half the reason i spazed out at band camp
i havent told anybody why yet
and i dont think im going to
its not the kinda thing i can just come out and tell people
plus it was more than just what was going thru my head
it was people pissing me off and not caring about it
i really hope no body finds that hole in the wall that i punched
the horrible thing is i cant even tell the guys what happened because that would put them in such a awkward postion and there too good of friends to do that too
i learned tat i can unwrap a starburst in my mouth and a piece of orbit gum
im still working on a hershey kiss but i know ill be able to do that too
i dont want to go back to band tomarrow
i only had 2 days off
thats not enough i need a week to recoupe
im still kinda sick and tired from the food up in edinboro
i dont want this school year to end
the sooner it does the sooner i have to loose all my friends to the real world
that will just fucking suck
i have to find out whats all going down tomarrow
guys never tell me anything
i guess i am not so confused
which is a good thing because im going into my second week and we have band camp in exactly 7 days
that also means school is right around the corner
and personally i dont want to technically go into the high school
i just want to move into the grade ahed of me
my grade is just so boring conforming and just like everyone else
which is horrible in my point of view
i gotta go because i have absolulty nothing to talk about and people i actually do talk to online might be getting on shortly or else i will have to be getting off very shortly either way it works
well its after the first week and im so confused i like all the music were playing its really easy
and our band has been doing good
we kinda made our first song called huh its sweet but we kinda wrote it in about 15 mins
we need the melody and the ska breaks now
the best song is surf wax america by weezer
i need still need to talk to some one
or i might possbly go insane
i havent seen the brendan leonard show in about a week or so now
but i have alot of
corey better not be acting like a jerk
he only has came to 12 of the practices
we need to get dan in the band
that way someone would actually be there to play
i cant wait for band camp
i really need to get a new bathing suit teh other one is too not there
and the guys will be there
well i have to go
i have to come up with dinner plans

i need some movie ideas
i gots my camcorder for xmas this year and all the editing equipment to go along
i need to write scripts and have willingnonpaid actors to come and be in my movies
i get to go back to school on monday
sarcasim i really dont want to go back because that means i have to see certain people
but on the other hand i will get to see the gorgeous jon see previous entry
there i am standing all alone on the sydney harbor brige
and you know i would jump into the fucking ocean if it meant i was truly capable of being satisfyed
will i ever be did i just give up the best thing i ever had the ataris
my head hurts my stomach hurts and im getting hungry
you might think this all seems like its too much
now i find out how much people really care
ive noticed that when you have to see a person repedtly its hard to get away from that person
its like your addicted to them
but when your givin an oppertunity to escape from them for a while people eat it right up finchaholic
im a very holic person
i absoultly love the song what its like to burn by finch
the construction lyrics emotion its all amazing
i think ive been listing to it for 2 days straight
ive also been consumed by megalomanic from incubus
its off of their new cd thats not out yet
also its like there old stuff like a mix of science and make yourself
i hope theres no snow on the ground for xmas
that way everyone is upset and it creates major chaos
what i wouldnt give to be able to make something go wrong
i feel bad for the fall from betweeners
they didnt win battle of the bands last night at peabodys
i think their egos are damaged a little
im still planning on seeing them for new years eve
i want to get a picture with the group and with the almighty jon
its one of the situations where you can look but you cant touch not only because hes taken but because he wouldnt spend a second of his time with the likes of me
belive me i do look
im on my search for something even though the lack for motivation isnt any help
i guess eventually someone will show up for me
i wish i had the power to take everything back the right and the wrong decisions that ive made and make it all diffrent
i want to move and become unknown
gotta go wrapup the fucking holidae shopping
think of today as a muchdeserved day of rest dear libra
you are usually the one people turn to when they need comfort and consolation
today however in spite of the tension thats in the air your words seem to have no effect
good let other people take care of themselves for a change
people never get what im trying to get across
they take it out of context and blow it out of proportion
i cant make a friendly gesture with out someone taking it wrong
wheres brendan leonard this was my favorite show over the summer and its gone i havent seen it in months
maybe someone thefted abcfamily of the tapes
i think i need to place a call to the russian mafia
its 1157 as i type
that means only 2 days until i can open up my xmas presents
note at the household we open gifts on xmas eve
just for the simple fact were too lazy to wake up early on xmas day and i dont feel like waiting that long
no one showed up today
i tried calling but his line was busy
i think he doesnt want anything to do with me anymore
its awefully funny sarcasim how they ditched us friday and how we havent gone anyplace just the normal 3 of us in a few weeks
i have a feeling somethings up
not like i could approch him about it though
oh yeah i could see it now
me how come we never do anything anymore him what do you mean me well we used to go places walk alot and talk on the phone
we dont do any of that anymore
why do you care so much me because i still like you alot
even though you used me and ect
him waaah that would go over ohsosmoothly
i need to move on to somebody else
somebody better who shows more respect and who dosent want me to be something im not
but i have no clue who that is
oh well i guess im not the likeable type because no one likes me like that
but i got sick both times after eating them
i think im allergic to peanut butter
and i gots some stuff to get yet
if i can i will write later
if not then i will tomarrow sometime
i hate getting up this early on weekends
its 931 and for all of you without an ohio residence its bright cold and windy outside
it is amazing to think that only 5 months ago i was laying around with friends complaining about being too hot and thinking that i was going to die of heat damage
but i guess that just goes on to prove that time is going by so quickly we dont fully have a concept of it
i think everyones comming over today
i hate the corny over the top extent that people go thru to make it special yeah its special enough to puke over
if i was in charge of a household i probably wouldnt even decorate
i see no sense in putting out all of this stuff like statues trees tinsel ect
for a month out of the year and then packing it all up so you can put yourself thru it again next year
i also hate the family gettogethers
actually i just hate family
they make to big of a deal about how ive turned out
i think i turned out just fine thank you
i dont steal i dont do drugs i do really good in school and i have alot of good friends
in my book that makes a pretty good person
im still sick if anybody was wondering
i dont think anybody cares about me
they care about using me
they care about having someone to take their anger out on or to get money off of
but once again im almost to the point where i absolutly dont care anymore
im gonna go think about some stuff
disorder rating paranoid moderate schizoid moderate schizotypal high antisocial high borderline very high histrionic high narcissistic moderate avoidant high dependent high obsessivecompulsive high personality disorder test take it oh yeah
this makes me feel plenty better about myself
atleast now i know something is wrong with me you should take the test
i just found a friend in one of your lies to treat me so nice i cant belive my bones
thats right folks its christmas vacation
a time of boredom insomnia fights and tears
i cant wait i know i know
i do need this break
i need it to take time from everyone whos been driving me up the wall the past 5 months
i dont think i have anymore wall to go up with out reaching the ceiling
new years eve will be fun though
sarah and i are going to go to the section 8 show to go and see fall from between
fall from between hit brookfield like a new boy band hits trl
all of a sudden everyone was a emo indie kid how amazing now dont take this the wrong way they are a pretty jazzy get together but when everyone and there grandma are so emolicious it gets kind of overrated
i want to go back to new york city
the people the sights it makes me feel all stuffed up and cloggy inside or maybe thats because i got sick again from it
tonsilitius pink eye ear infecton oh yeah i got it all
if anyone wants to be sick and miss some school call me
i wish i had someone i could talk to
someone i could spill my heart out to and they would listen
i dont have anyone like that
no one will listen to me
there too self absorbed to give a damn about me
it really makes me angry but theres nothing i can do about it
im not a mean person
as much as everyone tells me that i dont have to be nice to people i just cant help it
and with that people just walk all over me and use me as a welcome mat for there problems
maybe thats what i can attempt to change over break
im not going to be so willing to listen
maybe then they will all get the hint
its not like i have a choice
i just dont care anymore
things have been moving to fast to attempt to type it all
so i guess to avoid that i will continue from now
situations have come and gone but ive kept my cool and stayed the same
bonds have broken been fixed and broken again
but were on a road of empires and things like that just take its tole
things have happened in my life these past 3 months that will mean more to me than i ever know now
grandma dying breakups makeups and shake ups and i realized that some friendships are no longer there
but i guess this is just the cycle that i fell into and not by option
i have also been trying to figure out what people dont like about me
ive asked my camarades what they think
but they havent been able to come up with anything
i know im not a perfect sociable being
im also in search of something
something i honestly dont think ill be able to find
i still have attachments to a certian person and i have been trying to keep it a secret but people are catching on
if they catch on to anything its not algebra or science but who you have feelings for
i dont know what it is
like having feelings for someone new thinking about all of these horible things they never even did and such
but it doesnt work it makes me so aggravated
especially when you tell someone who you think you can trust and it turns out to be someone who cant keep there mouth shut
not mentioing any names or anything
but with all of this ive decided to use the energy for a greater good
like studying and reading manga
that thing also known as anime
its awesome im reading love hina and
well its harrys love hina but the other one is mine
things are definitly changing and i have no clue about what to do
but ill prolly write later
life is a jewish bastard
i hope you dont either
can you say ive had enough
sorry im the person i am
if i could i wouldnt be me
i went over to harrys today
then we went sledding for quiet awhile
we ran into tom and scott and went sledding with them
then we got cold and hungry and decided to head back
then we goofed off for a while and ate some dinner
i realized what i needed to along time ago
why am i the way i am why do i have to be the one stuck so depressed all the time and why do i have to be the odd one out by the whole vegetarian scheme if i was normal like every other skabunctious kid then maybe i wouldnt be such a problem
while im deep in thought im going to go listen to some early november and think about some stuff
its been a few days
spent the weekend with my aunt in hubbard
its cold as a mother outside
i havent been in much of a mood lately
i guess that comes from thinking too much
loneliness is a state of mind not a state of being
isnt that a true mission statement of life
i think later like around noon im going to place a call to the guys and see if they want to do anything
but its fuckingcoldass outside and i dont know if i want to brave the weather
but i dont think they know whats wrong with me
sometimes when i eat well after i eat i get really cold and really sick to my stomach all at the same time
then i get really dizzy almost blacked out
i dont think thats good
but thats between me and you
im almost done reading the first vol
of ceres its pretty good
then again i like alot of yu watatses works
i know this is short but i gotta go
im getting really sick again because i ate a poptart
maybe when the guys are here
i can have my brain back
you might think that because im cheerful in school
im cheerful all the time
three months untill permit time and 8 months and three days untill freedom
forever until i get a life and make things right
im gonna go because no body cares
well a few people might
and thats another story kids
people act like im stupid and cant see thru what their doing
but to reassure those certain folks i can
the outside shades the depths of reality
ive had it stuck in my head for the past week
its my life no doubt
kinda corny but it has a cool guitar part and the pedals are awesome
i want some chinese food
it used to all be fun and games until things changed
i want to be a pirate
ive had random dizzy nausea and tiredness spells
i dont think thats a completly normal thing
i cant tell the parents
i just got over having the flu tonsilitus bronchitus and almost namonia
im not a very needy person
i only want a few things
but i cant get those
i guess i either dont have any luck
or no one gives a fuck about me
im thinking its a combination of both
im going to go before i depress all of you too much
i wouldnt want it to wear off
you say hate is such a strong word
i use it most often
coming from an agnostic person i hope you should take my theory to heart
as ive seen more sorrow than you religious pukes will ever
i see the normal human being
they belive what theyve been taught from the start of their time
as long as you have absolution
others who are agnostic were most likley not grown up on religion
we just know that we are here and we can do what we want with it
well sitting there the other day i realized how sad i was and all the while i was thinking i bet the kid who prays before bed has never been as down as this and i bet he will never know what the end is like before it actually happens
then i put into my mind the prospective that if there was a lord that heals the wounded and aids the sorrow of the world that wouldnt this be a fitting punishment for all the disbelivers if i were god i would think so
im not saying the whole ordeal made me into a beliver because it didnt
but it made me think
its still making me think
its funny how i found myself and realized how i was played upon from your game but its my life dont you forget
well i was going to update yesterday but i didnt get online untill 1230 a
and by that time i was wayyy t tired
the guys came over yesterday dan harry and joe
we tryed to figure out songs for our band
i think we have one song on the list good job kids
then we decided to act like moerons and try snowboarding even though we have no snow only mud
then we played twister for like 3 hrs
omfg my knee hurts like a damn mofo its so cold outside
i dont want to go back to school tomarrow
how much more fun could it get
besides not having to do fucking midterm reviews that the bitchass teachers give us
the parentals are bugging me about college already
they wanna know what im gonna major in what school i wanna go to tuiton costs
i want to go somewhere in new york city like nyu
i want to do advertising layouts for people like musicians
that way i get to meet awesome people and yet i get paid good money
what more could you want i wish i lived in cocoa beach
that way i could surf all the time and be really good at it
and it would rarely ever get tooooo cooold
not like anyone is reading this besides you
this week has gone by really slow
but today and tomarrow should be a boat load of fun were all going to go get some chineese around 400
all include dan harry pat bob jeanette myself and i think thats it
then harry dan joe are all comming over tomarrow
i think rob is comming later
oh well gotta go plead with mom
lets rock da socks off well chineese was fun
though pat and jeanette didnt show
i forgot jen was grounded and that pat dosent do anything without his better half
so it was just me dan harry and bob
harrys gma was there too
i miss having our group together
just the 4 of us
it hasnt been that way in a while
so i guess things are just changing
have i ever told you i dont like change i dont like change
i didnt like the xsurfpunk07 thing
i gotta get an icon
plus i cant type hard the mother is sleeping
ppl cant live without me
i wanna stay 18 forever so we can stay like this forever and well never miss a party cuz we keep them going constantly and we never have to listen to anyone about anything cuz its all been done and its all been said were the coolest kids and we take what we can get brand new soco ameretto lime jonsessive axeulsive
today was very eventfull stressful and full of selfrealization i hate it
i dont know why i do the things i do like keep this blog write in a journal talk the way i talk dress the way i do act the way i do
theres so many things about myself that i want to change that i cant
i want to be thinner i want to be taller i want to be nicer
belive it or not theres so many things that you can come up with while writing a french paper
i came with a new slanguage
and im the biggest nerd you ever knew
but thats princess taltua to you
i got mad love for pippen
i dont think anyone could really expect a better production themselves
well today was the first day back to school
after a very long two weeks
things were in better condition than i expected them to be
harry talked to me like nothing was wrong
i thought he hated me
i bet rachel said something
i think im gonna buy a few packages of twizzlers just to attack bob with
and yes i still have welts on my arms
i bet dan does too
its been forever and 3ft since ive seen him
i swear to you he has grown like 3ft
hes almost as tall as me thats really ahmazing
i dont want to go back to school tomarrow
i think im getting sick again
i just got over being sick i have a theory that i need my tonsils removed
i dont want to have my tonsils removed
theres a certan extent that you can talk to a family member without them becoming extremly annoying or to a pont that they know way to much about you to ignore them
because that folks is were a little thing called blackmail comes in
i need to find the alice 19th mangas
waldens didnt have them but they did have
hack and im reading that but i like alice 19th better
but what else is high school about the worlds resting on my shoulders and no ones here to help
you are kusakabe marron kaito jeanne you are generous and talented though often widthdrawn
you tend to have just a few close friends rather than many
you appear very cheerful and enthusiastic but struggle to keep up with what others expect of you
in the end your perseverance and sacrifices help you pull through
take the what magic girl are you quiz
dont scurry this wont take long
i dont think i need away messages
everytime i put up and away message something important is asked or happened
and by the time i check those messages theyre signed off
wtf yesterday bob wanted to get some people together and go to the movies
i have been wanting to do that for soo long but because my away was up i didnt get the message and he signed off
then what happens is if i dont put up my away message then no one will message me and i am stuck browsing the net untill i have seen everything
and people told me that it was impossible umph i watched a movie yesterday
it was actually really kinda cool untill the last 10 mins
when things got totally unbelieveable
like a ghost cutting this fucking annoying psychic up and she just stood there like a moron screaming covered in blood
i was disapointed in tim
he was so awesome and became my favorite and he had the cheesiest ending
the blair witch kind of thing
ryan a girl was really lame too
she was the most terrifyed and also had one of the cheesiest endings
her table started shaking and she fell thru the floor
they all ended up in some tourcher chamber that was secretly hidden thru a closet in the house
tim found it first they did have some good aspects like the chair hey kids that one worked
but wtf havent you ever seen a scurry movie before alright
i get frustrated when filmaking goes wry

i hate being so funny and so loud
i wish i was more quiet and serious about alot of stuff
i wish i was more studious
people cant take me seriously
i cant take my self seriously
maybe thats the reason i can never get a boyfriend
they have infurity complexes when im around because im so loud
guys always have to be the center of attention

i never seem to have anytime

nevermind ive got something else to complain about
i am going to go far away
that way i can live on the beach surf and go to school where the people dont know me and everything would be all fine an dandy
i cant wait until i drive
i can just get up and go
i dont care and i doubt you do
oh snap jesus that kid gots kicks
this is time for another instalment of things that make heather mad and what she hates
alot of things have been making me mad
dont ask me why because i am normally a very notmad person
like i cant stand it when people ask me a million bizgillion questions on the saaame topic i mind you that i told them from the get go i dont know much about
okay the second thing that makes me angry is when people say that there going to do something and they dont
when they completly blow the person off
i cant stand that for the life of me
its really nice outside but do you think i have anyone to go walking with or go do something with no
i am such a loser that i have to spend it all inside on the computer typing in this damn blogger because no one ever wants to do anything
ugh phew now onto what i hate
i hate alot of things latley
i dont normally hate anyoneanything
i dont know whats wrong with me
im not going to go into an extreme amount of detail but yeah
it makes me soo aggravated because i cant say what i want to say
i always feel like im saying something stupid
or that something isnt right
people have that affect on me
i hate my four wheeler because i accidently blew out one of the tires last winter and i havent been able to ride for like 3 months now
riding was defnintly one of my ska things
that makes me so mad
i dont know what to do
but dont worry about me
because no one ever has and no one ever will

i made the amazing new discovery that i absolulty am over the past and i could care less its great
i havent felt that way in a long time
yes that means i feel ska
today when i woke up i thought about nothing at all
i had no worries i had no complains except it was too early and i was still tired no stress about anything
i found by the way a new band that is awesome
well they may not be new but they are awesome
the postal service i love it its like emotrancebrighteyes goodness i need some more pink lemonade
that stuff makes it possible ill take o for the win
oh we suceeded in finding my ska thing
as odd as it may sound its emo music but in the same sense its something else
yeah i guess you could say that
there a good band too goodness sarahs rapidly increasing a
d case is slowly wearing off onto me
i want to make a movie the true life of ding dong ditch
and go around and play the prank on lots of people and have me catch it all on film
i was kinda depressed today
i didnt get any carnations
everyone else did but not me
i wish i could of gotten a silly flower
even though it will die just like everything else
but oh well enough of the sad stuff im gonna skidattle
who ever is reading this needs to sign the tagboard
if i told you that today was a very eventful than i was wrong
this could get eventful finish later
ive got some talking to a certain person to do
today has been very boring
tommarow we get out early
i might end up riding the bus home with sarah and spend the night over there
i have been in a really good mood today
for some randomly odd reason
its been a few days
today i realized just how much my life sucks
all i do is come home go straight to the internet get off read do homework and go to sleep
im the ephiphany of a geek
theres a new kid in school
got a good sense of humor nice personality
someone i need to get to know better
valentines day is in three days
another valentines day wasted on my own self loathing because im too big of a loser to have anyone
and me and sarahs buisness hasnt recieved any customers
if i could see into the future when i was 6 and see just how i turned out i would killed myself then
ill take x for the block
school does nothing but bore me anymore
the only class i actually enjoy would be algebra because its a challenge public speaking because kozar is a riot and the people are awesome in there
and french is above all because it owns
dont listen to i love you not by homegrown
its nothing but a flashback
yeah all my entries are like i have add
im thinking about everything wayy to much again
when that happens i start feeling sick
why cant anything good ever happen to me i think ive paid my dues
you would also think wrong
i need to work on this gay template and figure stuff out
first of all i didnt get enough sleep last night
plus i was stupid and took 3 advil before i layed down
that means ill be sick for the rest of the week
mistakes are misleading you shouldnt think what youre feeling
death cab for cutie lightness
that has never been any clearer to me
i need to talk to rachel
i talked to her for quite a while online
were both basically in the same boat
she will be very interested in what i hafta inform her of
he always enjoed being the bearer of bad news
igby goes down olie same here
maybe you should call me igby
yeah i know i havent written in here since forever
alot has been going on
well not that you could easily tell with my lack of communication to the outside world
yeah i have been thinking about lots of stuff
you know that it is never good when i think about lots of things
such an interesting frame of mind
i wish that i could come right out and say everything that i have ever wanted to whoever i wanted
maybe all of this would then go away
everywhere i go it seems that i unleash another memory
it has almost been 6 months and i still cant seem to get a grasp on anything
like yesterday i went to best buy to get death cab for cutie because im in love with like 4 songs off of it and when i walked down the cd aisle i passed this guy and at that moment i got the largest wiff of axe from him
that brings back too many itself
last time i said anything about it to someone i got relayed back to him
thats not gonna happen again
i watched the greatest film that i have ever seen in a long time last night
its called igby goes down
it has kieran culkin who is for those of you who dont put two and two together mccaulay culkins younger brother
anyways the movie held to many truths to my own life that i dont want to go into detail about and bore you with so ill save you from that
ok i in relation to what is going on in my head i have kinda reached some questions that i cant quite seem to answer because i dont have all of the answers
if a person reaches a point of lonliness does that person slowly start to forget about what made them sad in the first place like do they get to a point where its such a culmination of a million things that they forget who or what has caused it from the start i think i have
maybies i can get the guys to come over tomarrow
its so boring when they dont come over
especially in the winter because there is absolutly nothing to do
i mean no fiznucking shiz gotta love espio
what famous leader are you personality tests by similarminds
crammed packed never ending weekend of mayhem
ive got nothing to rant nor rave about this weekend so i guess ill just describe to you what i did
came home ate went online and sat around until about 245
then i went back to school so i could go to track practice
yeah i was there until about 430
though all we did was streches blocks and 3100s
after when i came home i did nothing but sit around
saturday got up at 7 because of my loud and ingnorant father who decided to be loud when he was getting ready for class woke me up
left at 830 and stopped at the gerocry store so i could get some powerade continued up to the school where the bus left at 900 got to austintownfitch at 930 ran the 100 in 19
5 seconds and ran the 200 in 41
3 seconds i could of been faster in both damn blocks i didnt get home from that until 430
so when i came home i was in a really good mood and i played a little volleyball and sat around until randomly harry showed up in my house soon followed by dan and ryan
then they ubducted me and we went down to the school so i could film dan trying to do a ollie over a skateboard on a skateboard in 13 takes while i was down there i called back to my house to let my mom know where i was and i asked her if i could spend the night
so i did and we ended up sitting around playing the 007 game which was being gay as hell and harry kept using my shoulder as a pillow so we all ended up going to bed at like 230
sunday woke up at 930 and sat in the living room because no one else was up yet
when everyone finally got up we all watched weird science except dan because he was still sleeping until he left at like 1045 and then dazed and confused i left around 130
came home ate something and did some shiz on the computer
the guys showed up at my house at like 200 ish and then we walked to downtown sharon where we sat around for a few hours
walked back to my house at 5 ish layed around for a hour or so and attempted to play twister until my mom came home
then they left at 630 ish
since then i have been doing a combination of computercleaningdinnerbathalias
alias comes on in 2 mins woo
i only hate certian personpersons
you guessed it ladies and gents
this calls for another round of things that make heather incredibly angry
sometimes people have more than friendship feelings for somebody else
therefor that person wants to get closer to the other person for this instance well use victim in refrence to the other person
at the same time the hunter is hoping that the vicim feels the same way
now normally the vicim would show this by a thing called massive flirting more than norm contact verbally and physically and by many other things
we like to call that leading the hunter on
if any of you are not familiar with anything i have just been ranting about i suggest locking yourself in your room listing to mad amounts of emo and if you are totally lost call ben
now there are circumstances when the vicim is how should i put this socially retarded
well ima put this into diffrent terms
argh that makes me so mad
and if you dont know who i am talking about i honestly dont think you have any right to be reading this
im going to go were all going over to harrys and then to the buhl club for swimming
its not like i can ask you what you want to hear first the good news or the bad news
so ill give you the good first
plus i dont actually have bad news other than my life
good shiz i get my permit in a month
which is awesome yeah cuz today is the 20th and my bday is october 20th
keep that in mind so next month is my 15 and a half cele w00t bad shizncking shiz nothing has really changed with me so far
other than the fact i dont like a certian person that will remain unmentioned because of the fact i am not outgoing and i am a quiet person
cough so im just calling it quits on that little project
well last night at the mall with the guys bobdanharrychrisjoeish tonights gonna be fun too were all heading over to bobs house same people and watching a few good movies yay i dunno when ill be home im not heading over there until 530ishel

song ill catch you the get up kids mood througly depressed
today was such a fun day wow
i can lie really good
i dont know whats wrong with me anymore
maybe its because i dont wanna know
theres so many things that make everything so wrong
its too hard to concentrate on them all
i wish i could just spill my heart out to some one but i cant find anyone who would want to listen that hasnt hurd it all before
my life is one big block of cheese
it just sits there and lets the world take its tole without fighting back
that is soooo not pimp
i need to loose weight and fast
i also need to run some for track before it actually starts
i have been lifting though that way when i gotta throw i have a arm
i dont know if i want to go to that ska concert now
i might but i dunno
i havent been feeling the slightest bit of ska latley
that is definitly not pimp
if anyone would like to come and save me one of these days id be more than happy to be saved
ima go before i get you sad
song all we ever needed the early november mood
im reading this new series its pretty nifty
called jing king of bandits deals with a guy called jing and his crowassistant named kir
it shows a bunch of diffrent things
theres also pirates in it
that scores it about 10 points extra
deary me i am so excited
track starts next week that means i have to go on a diet
i need to workout more
the only problem is i dont have determination enough to stick to any solid routine
i havent had pop in like a week
no i do not have chipmunk cheeks
i wonder what it would look like if i wrote everything backwards
sdrawkcab gnihtyreve etorw i fi ekil kool dluow ti tahw rednow i
that was so nifty you know what i hate well theres alot of things but lets zoom in on one
i hate when people use me and then try and pull it off like they did nothing
it makes me so mad
song capitalism stole my virginity the international noise conspiracy mood been better
sorry i didnt write yesterday but i was gone almost the whole day
the guys are amazed at my video game playing skills
they didnt think i could play
today was just another blur nothing good has happened
i want to go to the last fall from between show at north sharon firehall but nooo im not allowed
i might hafta make it another secret mission
i had a good day of workin out today
phew we did 10 grovers and a 800 meter run two laps then we did 100 of backpedals kneehighs and buttkicks
fun for the whole family
im really glad i joined track this year because ive lost alot of fat
i need to loose more though so i can be less fat
whispering actually i can make a mess like nobodys buisness everyone needs to go download this song
com yeah if you dont your lame
i need to go get the new episode of red vs
i dont even know anymore
nor do i want to
yeah im going to go
all i can do is ramble
sigh i have no clue what is going to happen
you know i thought i was at a perfect situation
i had plenty of people that i hung out with i had very good grades hell i even made it on the honor roll with a 3
i ran in track and each time i ran i got better
what could be better honestly
but now i dont know
i hate where i live the people ive hung out with dont want to hang out with me nor talk to me
my grades in some of my classes are starting to slip because ive been doing so much i havent the time to study and do all my homework
it seems as though all that has ment anything to me is just slipping away
and of coarse it had to happen right before summer vacation
cant i be happy for more than a 8 or 9 month amount of time seriously
i just dont know anymore
i need to go listen to more of the early november
then i need to go to sleep where i dont realize how shizzy things have gotten
way away away from here ill be
i have had it up to here
go take your shiz somewhere else
i cant stand any of you anymore
but only a select few argh
i dont feel like talking
go have fun with your friends
you know what i cant stand this anymore
why cant i say what i want to say i want to sit everyone down and tell them exactly what i feel why i feel it
i dont want to just play around anymore
this sucks like a mother
i still dont feel like talking
tomarrow is gonna be fun
i get to do the 1600 4 x 2 relay the 200m dash and the longjump
yeah so i guess im a distance runner now
as long as i think that ive got nothing to loose
i need to make a new mix for track
that way ive got stuff i can think of
saving me from all of this would just be too much for you
why do you people think im going to flip out about everything i dont get any of you
i told you before im not a mean person
why must you act like i am i dont feel like much talking except for a few people
and most likely you arnt one of them
thats all i can say is wow
sometimes people never fail to surprize me even now
if you spend enough time with a person when its just you and them the person can turn out to be almost completly diffrent than they normally act around you
i definitly have a new respect for someone
i have absolutly no courage
but im also lacking major in the selfesteem selfconfidence all of the above
i think i might need to work on that in order to aproch the aprochee
yeah about that im definitly not saying anything to anyone else
im definitly going on a hour and a half of sleep
thats so not cool man
i didnt sleep until about 9 in the morning until about 1030
but for some odd reason im okay
i mean i had the all day track meet east palestine from 730 a
when i got home then i walked down to harrys hung out there came home and got my clothes went back down and hung out all night
and i basically just got home
sounds like loads of fun right damn right it was fun
i bet you wernt expecting me to say that were ya well
i cant wait to talk to someone seriously when i wasnt talking to this person he was always online
and now that im not hes not on
hes still talking to me
does that make me mary wow
i hafta talk to rachel martin today
i have somethings to tell her a few updates
itll be gravy and shell be mad then shell be sad and it wont be gravy anymore
but thats okay because thats what im here for i listen to everyones problems i dont know why i just do
i dont like to all the time but i honestly cant be mean
i dont have it in me
i wish that i could be mean sometimes just to know what its like then id want to turn back because i dont think that i could go that long with out cracking a joke or being antimean
some people think i am mean already
i dont think im mean
you know what i am so totally just rambling on and on and on and on in this entry its crazy shiz pimp
i guess thats what happens when you get this little of sleep worry about everything thats going to happen are mad hungry and kinda bored out of your mind because there is no one here besides me and the rents
its amazing that i can go from never being allowed to do anything to actually finding that i barley spend anytime at home
not like thats a bad thing or anything because its all fun and games but i do get tired after a while
im so freaking sleepy man
no regrets right i think i need to stop worrying so much
i think it might be making me go bald
even though im not going bald
it might soon if i dont stop
im going to go before i ramble on even more
see you on the flip to the dip side
welcome to another addition of the special brodcasts from random peoples homes for this lovley saturday night im talking to you from harrys house
everyone is basically over its gonna be a party w00t
yeah i had that track meet this morning at like 730 til about 6ish
that was so not fun but i didnt get as burned as i did last weekend
im still in a crappy mood from last night
but im kinda better now
but not like that matters
i have the get up kids stuck in my head i really want to talk to somebody in perticular and i cant which makes me mad but im not a home so that makes me unmad
what is it about me that drives people away im serious as all hell about this one too
is there something that i do that people dont like and they just dont tell me about if there is you should let me know because i hate feeling like this
especially when i have no one to talk to and im just stuck thinking about it forever
thats never a good thing
i dont think i wanna know
please dont tell me its because im emo
ive hurd enough of that to last me a lifetime and then some
track meet tomarrow morning 730 a
it doesnt matter what i do
the world does not care what i do
which completly screws with the concept of this journal its self
im sure a few of you get a joy out of reading this
thats all im saying kids wow
i want to go back
i need to go back
i need to listen to mustard plug and big d
can anyone help a sista out of you do ill owe you big
tonight is the big show
actually its not really big
theres only four bands planet smashers catch 22 mustard plug and big d and the kids table
im taking the guys up
too bad i dont think im taking god up
that would rock rock rock
if god graces me with his presence tonight ill be a happy girl
ill also be a happy girl if i meet some new boys
another song you kids need is long goodnight by the get up kids and i belive in a thing called love by the darkness
those are pretty nifty selections
i actually wanted to catch some sleep before we hit the road but i dont know if ill be able too
esecially because i have a high hatetred for ska
that makes no sense and why am i going right well put it too you this way its a show and its in cleveland only 10 and im going with the guys
ive never been to a show with them
if i dont die in the pit first
im going to go if anyone wants to come along tonight your more than welcome
just bring some powerade and all will be fine
this sucks and like everything else in life it is going to turn out bad
because im sorry to break it to you folks luck just doesnt happen
luck is won over and bought just like everything else in this world
i hate what society has done to society
if you watch movies from eras like the 50s 60s and such they all look so comfortable
comfortable with their friends homes and everything that was going on around them
why cant it be like that now if anyone can answer that for me ill owe it too you because nothing good ever happens to me
im just plain tired kids
ive got no more motivation no energy and no expectations
if this isnt the low life i dont know what is
i could really care less about writing in here today but theres nothing else too do
i might see if the guys want to help me film
today isnt a good day
i need someone to come over
if anyone would like to save me i will love you forever
this is a special entry cuz im writing from my aunt kathys house
yesterday was so long and boring i dont even know where to start
i ended up waking up at like 630 yesterday and went to track at like 10
the meet was at mineral ridge
we were there until seven freaking oh clock
not to mention i also look like a freak since harry injured my eye with the fake sword and i got so sunburnt that i hurt
i really need to do some filming
i only have three days left to get my video done
now i really feel like a director
i want to watch the first season of red vs
ive been so freaking busy its not even funny
i cant belive school is almost over
we only have like less than two months left
to me thats both sad and great at the same time
i definitly cannot wait until i graduate
that way i can leave and move to new york city
if anyone else would like to tag along with me let me know
i honestly dont know if i want to go to california
i think it would be really fun
i know that i need to be alone and on my own for a while
i dont see where that would differ from now
i mean im honestly like never home anymore
im usually always either at school track or im at harrys
and usually if i am at home the guys always end up stopping over or something
my mom thinks that its odd that i only have a few friends that are girls
i dont know why i dont
i mean yeah there nice to talk to and all but i barley have anything in common with any of them
the only girls im really friends with are rachel and sarah
well there are others but i dont ever talk to them or hang out with them outside of school
i wonder why they took off the show where in the world is carmen san diego i dont get that
i get to have pop now
but really i dont want it
it tastes really funny and i dont feel to good after it
you all need to go listen to muse
i mean so awesomerific that i cant even hand gesture it enough to you if anyone has any tips on how to woo someone let me know
well im going to skidattle because this internet is really gay i love you dsl and i gotta get ready to go home
you know what i hate everything about this
i cant stand it anymore
everytime i think thimgs maybe looking up they pull a 180 and smack me right in the head
i cant stand any of this anymore
why do i have to sacrifice so much for someone to make them a better person when its most likly hurting me a hundred times more
maybe i just dont want to get it
im ready to move now
if i had some money id buy a train plane or bus ticket now go to nyc and forget about all of this
thats what i need to do
i cant keep going through this
if i do i think in time my head will explode
even though death itself isnt horrible i dont think i want to be remembered as the human bomb
i dont get anything anymore
its a system of chores that require no thought
that has too many faults
maybe if i was cooler and maybe if i talked more maybe if i was pretty people would like me too
when i say people i mean guys
i guess i just need to change something
cuz this system i have going for myself isnt doing anything for me
i dont feel like talking anymore
yeah this is my 100th post
that is so nifty go figure this is a special post and im not even making it from my own house
o yeah by the way this is another edition of posting from a random persons house
im sitting in joes living room with dan harry and joe
hibbittyhibbhib im so freaking happy today was such a good great awesomrifical day i cant wait till tomarrow
and then the cookoutthinger at joes house
id say today was a pretty good day
rachel martin said something to jon before i got a chance too
i guess it went a little something like this
rachel so hows dan jon
heather rachel well not yet but uhh
well if that wasnt the best ice breaker ive ever seen
or hurd i should say ya know
this summers gonna be fun
even with all the doubt floating around
i have so much freaking stuff to do
i have to do three algebra assignments two are due tomarrow
one is due on wednesday
i have a journal study guides and and essay due through out the week let alone the test on the gayest book in the world
i cant read it without falling asleep
things are slowly going to start improving though
ive seen the smiles fall to many times before let me ask you is this what youve been waiting for eep
today has been so boring
ive done nothing but work on my ps speech and va and then i had to finish reading of mice and men
i hate that book with a passion
steinback may be a very respectable author but where the hell did he come up with an idea for that book crazy bastard
and on top of that i have to write an essay which is due tuesday on that book
i cant even read 10 pages without dozing off or falling asleep completly
i want to get the guys together and go to chineese and then to the movies
it sounds like some fun
i cant wait until marching this summer
its going to be so much freaking fun
im going to be so sad though because steph tj doc browning all of them are going to be seniors next year
when the guys grade goes im going to be so screwed
thats why i have to make the best of it now
ill write either later if i get bored or tomarrow
today has definitly been the best day that i think ive had in quite a while
i mean seriously i think if anything
well almost anything would have been any diffrent then i dont think i would of had that great of a time
you know that feeling you get when someone likes you and you like them even though youre not together its still so much freaking fun yeah thats what ive got right now
i definitly have gotten to know and hang out more with a certain someone
it kinda makes me sad to know that because of a certain person ive missed out on knowing them all of this time
maybe something would of happened earlier if i could of but all that shiz behind me earlier
im not going to let it bother me
why because on the rare occasion that i can honestly say im happy
i dont want to miss any second of it
im definitly going to go to sleep now
cheers and goodnight to ya all
this year has gone by really fast
like really really ridiculously fast
it stil kinda feels like the first day of school
maybe thats just because im a big weirdball
i might get to play piccolo in marching band
id rather be play drums but hey its not a flute
i gotta go do the relay for life tonight
im glad im doing it
not only for community service but for grandma uncle russel and aunt mary
i cant belive theyve all past away in the last 9 months
all from the same thing too
so dont even get me started
tomarrow is the band trip im so freaking excited harrys not going to be there which i mean yeah hes like one of my best friends and all but uhh yeah
this will definitly give me a break
and ill be able to hang out with dan without having harry all over me
yeah if jon is reading this because he clicked the link in my profile please talk to your brother
wth is up with that ya know thaaaaanks
well im going to go
i wanna sleep a little or do some algbra
ill prolly write more after r
today was such a horrible day
you have absolutly no fucking clue
i all i could do was sit there and think about all the shiz thats been going on some of the shiz that happend last night and everything else
might see what the guys are doing since i have nothing better to do
how can spending so much time with one person make them mean so much to you even though you know they dont think of you as anything
i dont know what to think anymore
things like this make me so aggravated
you know what after spending the weekend alone ive came to alot of conclusions
ive realized what ive got in life what i thought i had in life and what i need
its almost disappointing but at the same time its motivation to work towards all of that
i found out who i dont want anymore
i also realized i definitly need to stop living in the past
all that shiz that went down this past summer is all that it is
im honestly trying not to care anymore
summertime selfrealeyesation at its finest folks
today has been a good day so far
i didnt go to track today dad didnt let me
so i went and took the test portion of my permit thing and i passed that
but i feel sick and im really hungry so you wouldnt be able to tell if you saw me
have i ever told you how much i love ramen
i think after we get done gerocery shopping im going to see what the guys are up to
then maybe we can hangout or whatever
its 754 in the morning and im up because last night i went tanning and ive ended up looking mildly like a lobster
also i have track in about an hour and im feeling really nauseaus
weather its from the tanning thing not getting a good nights sleep or the medicine because i am sick i dont know
last night i do know when i got up to put lotion on i got really dizzy and felt like i did when i passed out that one time
and thats not good because i have alot of stuff to do today
i have to get the part b thing go to the bank put in app
at the golf coarse and stop in at tmobile
ima get my yearbook on monday
ive got to get some people to sign it
man i think ima be sick
o yeah i definitly had the weirdest dream last night
something about aliens and a guy and hubbard and random kids bible questions french kids
it was too much chaos for me so i just woke up
i dont want to do anything today
i dont think anyone cares
ima go step outside for a few
maybe the fresh air will help me
ill write in here tonight
ive been trying to watch this world news stuff okay
all you see are the little iraqi and palestinian kids throwing stuff at our boys over there and all i have to say are where the hell are there parents
if i lived over there my mom or dad would be like helloh get your rear in gear and get in this house the usa is marching around mr
rogers neighborhood with a few mk40s and gernades
its not safe to play in the street at times like these
i want to move to cocoa beach
i want to surf again
today wasnt a good day
for some reason ive just been very depressed
maybe because ive been thinking about everything
like when i see a few people
its not good for me ya kno
well you dont know because
its curently 82 in my house and its 626
it should be like 65 or 75
then it would be comfortable
this d00ds is not comfortable
my mother is driving me crazy
i was like oh hey im home and none of my friends felt like caring about me tonight so i guess ill speak a few words to my mother
and she repeats herself over and over and over again
my head is going to explode
i swear shes my source of constant headache
its going to be impossible to stay here all summer
i hope she knows that
going to be living at harry bob or dans house
just as long as its not my own
i need a hobby besides being online i think
i spend hours on end in front of this thing
i think ive rambled enough
god she wont shut up
if anyone can save me tonight ill owe you something big
today was a very interesting day
i missed fifth period today which is a shame because i love that class more than any of my other classes
i love learning foreign languages
my dads taking a summer spanish coarse this year hes going to teach me how to do it
that will be really nifty
then ill be able to speak 3 languages by the time im 16
you wanna know something im really sick and tired of hearing about other peoples problems
i mean sometimes if something happens and they need someone to talk too yeah of coarse im here for them
but when every single day and its the same problem it gets really aggravating
especially when the problem could have easily been avoided if they would have just payed attention in the first place
why else do people make mistakes
just so other people can make them too and fall into the same hole i dont think so
im so glad tomarrow is friday
i hope we dont have saturday practice
i really really dont want to practice on the weekend
ive already got alot planned
get part b done 2
im sure were all going to go spend the night at someones house this weekend
its all good fun though dont get me wrong
i think im going to go
ive got some french and algebra to get done
hey there lazy chair i figured since they reformatted blog i needed to have a catchy phrase
tac8 meet is tomarrow for all of you interested the field events start at 430 and the running events start at 500 newton falls
so if youre in the area its gonna take you a while ta get there
im running in the everpopular 200m dash and the 400m dash
that means we only have one meet left that we all get to participate in
reginals arnt until thursday of next week
but i got my pahstah and my gatorade with water on the side
so i should be fine and dandy
ima write in here later
because i feel like it
my head is going to explode
evangelion will make you go insane
im gonna end up like auska if i keep it up
i need to write in my real journal more often too much has built up
im in like unbeliveable pain 247
season is almost over along with school
this freshman year has gone by so fast
its like it was yesterday i was just starting to hang out with the guys and i was so selfconcious around them
and everyone else for the matter of fact
im still selfconcious but i think that i do a good job hiding it from everyone so atleast it doesnt seem like i am
ive also made a few good friends along the way
thats some crazy shiz right there lemme tell you
i dont think ive really changed emotionally too much though
im really happy or really sad
theres not much in between
i really need to finish watching evangelion
i loooooooooove that anime with all my heart
corey is totally awesome for letting me borrow all 13 tapes of it
like that is ever going to change
im telling you im going to die an old and decreped old lady whose never ever been married
im going to go and see what the guys are up too then i can figure out what im going to do tonight
i can tell you one thing i wont be home
saving me would be too much charity for the likes of you
would it all be better if i wasnt here you know just as i thought i had things figured out they of coarse had to go ahead and change
i thought i knew what i wanted where i was going in life what i was going to do in life
i guess when you get too comfortable with that kind of thing all hell must break loose
because it surley is causing havoc now
i mean why the hell do i even bother anymore
it leads me no where and always seems to dissapoint me
i thought that i would make my move and maybe have a slight chance at being happy
even if it was for a moment
you think thats going to happen now think again
thought i was going to new york city when i graduated
why because fucking colleges have decided to rob their students of funds and make it extremly unaffordable to pay your way in
and to top it all of i just dont know anymore
just a hint for you all dont take tylenole thinking it will take away enough pain
because it doesnt and then it sucks
i would love to express all of this to the group but how many tears can you shed until it gets too old
i know they said i have to talk to them because that is what we do we talk
but heres a prime example of the old saying its easier said than done
ive been like this for 15 almost 16 years of my life
youd think id be used to it by now
maybe if i dressed up everyday wittled away my fatness to nothing and cared about absolutly nothing in the world just maybe then i could be happy
is it the pessimistic side of me that scares everyone away no one has ever seen this side of me in person
this is what i keep to myself and what id hate to put onto you guys because i dont think anyone needs to go thru exactly what i am going thru because its not their problems
i dont know what to do with myself anymore
i dont want to have to do anything for myself
i just want to be okay
i dont care if im uberly happy but i dont want to be like this
i just dont want to care anymore because i dont care
but theres that thing in the corner of my mind thats like no you must care because it is your life
you know you guys dont see me like this
you dont see any of it
all you see is the happy go lucky girl that is cool to be around
if you knew i was like this from the start would you still want to be around me im not a basketcase though
if thats what youre wondering
i just have no one i feel safe enough spilling all this too
and i really must say i hate all of the phoney people who pretend to care about what im going thru
because i hope you know that i can tell
i can see it and i know
let me tell you something
why cant i just be able to say all of this
is it really that hard
or is it just the fact i havent found the right person to say this all too
it kills me on the inside
and i could write it all out exactly what im feeling
when it comes to saying it though i cant
or when i do i mess it up and everyone gets pissed off at me because im horrible at words
you guys wonder why i dont tell you people anything
i think what it is is that im just not good enough
i mean im good enough to hang out with and too listen to everyones problems
but im just not it
how do i get like this is it my subconcious building and building until it cant hold all of this and it spills out into my normal state of conciousness
because not long ago i was fine
then maybe i can find what it takes to be happy
maybe i can find someone who understands me
because right now the only person i find myself to be happy around couldnt care less about me
and hes not who you think he is
i guess it always has to come down to this because alas this is all ive got
just me and everything that i think about because i cant do anything else but think of things
then why the hell am i here i dont know but i am starting to think it would all be better if i wasnt here
maybe not in the united states itself
k so i typed out a really really freaking long post today before i left and my gay computer froze so i had to reboot without saving
sucks right yeah i thought so too
i st around for like the first half of the day
yeah fun for the whole family its assured
then me and rach went to jons grad party for like an hour i was kind of bummed that we had to leave before they played they ffb but i got my pic and one of me and dan too
so i guess all was not lost
then after i came over too joos and met up with the gentlemen harry bob joe and ryan
i actually got to spend the night for like once in a very long time
its been like a week
sucks the parents are stil being nazians
i swear its all the mothers doing
if shes unhappy she wants the rest of the known and free world to be unhappy right along with her
i cant wait til dad starts his new job that way hes home more in the afternoon ish
i swear because of the habit of staying up until like 3am on the pc i cant make it past like 12 with out a computer muse and water
i think i will die
i just got really really depressed all of a sudden i have no clue why
maybe because this is what i do when im at home and im always depressed there
i think all of this is taking alot of me
i mean im the mediator of the group
i listen to everything thats going on with everybody which i cant completly say that i dont like because thats why im here
but whenever i try to tell them my shiz they always have to turn it into something about them
and all the stuff between me and dan
well i guess i should say lack of things that are going on between me and him
i like him so much doesnt he realize this i mean goodness
i hate it so bad
great there making fun of me because im a vegetarian
i dont know anything anymore
i wish i could have sometime alone
or atleast someone to talk to
i mean really talk too
but i dont have that either
maybe i do need to move
im too used to this pattern of things
if i had change i would be okay i think
maybe thats why i never kept friends for a long amount of time
maybe i think about all of this stuff way too much
that could be my problem
then again who knows no one because everyone has their head wrapped around there own situation and there way to busy to listen to me
actually i do but heh you guys sure as hell wouldnt know about that
i didnt do much yesterday
im supposed to go to the aquabats and planet smashers show today up at the agora
i really freaking want to go
but everyone counted on me as a ride when i told them not too because things were up in the air so alas we have no ride
dads working up on the roof and mom has to be to work tomarrow at like 5 in the morning
damn i wish i could drive
i havent even gotten out on the road yet when ive had my permit for about two months now
things are startng to make me aggrivated
maybe i need a break from people
i think thats what it is
people depend on me too much
i dont know why they would be like that with me
im going to go find something to do
maybe ill play some stuff on my guitar
from when i was very young it would always make me forget everything around from me and come into a very blissful or simple state
throughout all my life its been an escape from everything and as you are in that process of escape you see all those layers peel away or all those things that imprison you in your life
to me thats the only thing that is me everything else is down to evolution and where i was on the planet i could have been anyone and im trying to find the most basic simplistic form of what i am
i can relate to those moments in my life when ive been playing music its like music is my origin of symmetry
too much i never know
it sums up what music means too me because someone who im not mentioning doesnt get it
nu that has to be about the funniest thing ive seen all day
i suggest you check it out you guys may not get the jokes though
i dont know what im going to do today
the guys havent called so i might end up staying home the whole day
i need a big serving size meal of a life
i want to be in a band
of coarse the band we have now hasnt done anything and at this rate i dont think that we will be doing anything
the brother and lilly came over today
i didnt hang with them much
bill and i are too quiet
maybe the guys will show up at the house
post 111 everyone see the video for uno by muse if you have youll know what im talking about
im so happy i finally got my album thing up for everyone too look at
i just need more pics now
but ive got some from ska is dead and im going to that concert on monday hopefully crosses fingers i really wanna see the planet smashers w00t
tomarrow is a big birthday extravaganza rachel martins turning 14 and maggeys turning 16
i wish i had a summer birthday
no mine has to be in the cold and rainey fall
cant wait until i turn 16 its like in 4 months and 9 days
im definintly going to have a sweet birthday party
might have my party in the summer
that way we can actually party
insted of freezing lumberjackstyle on the deck
i wanna have a super killer pool party
for the cool kids at my school
do you have cha hee hee
thats super rad my friend
im gonna go so i can go do
i woke up at noon
i feel like i need more sleep though
todays going to be boring i can tell
i bet you any money that they wont call
it bothers me but i highly doubt they want to spend everyday with me
i dont know who would
you know its only june 9th and im already bored
this is going to be one long summer
wonder when there going to kansas
need to find that out
maybe me and someone can spend some good time together
i dont know why i try so hard
id like to think im getting somewhere
gotta find something to do
sitting here thinking way too much
i wish i didnt worry about everything the way i do
i dont know what to do about anything anymore
i try so hard to make things go the way they should
and no reason why i should try to go on anymore my reasons all gone no reason why you should try to make excuses to make me feel alright excuses call for stupid reasons and i know that its not much that i can offer right now just give me one little second and i will try my hardest to make you feel like im someone else
n understand why i love that band
i dont want anyone to think im something im not
or that im a certain way that im not
i cant help it though
you people dont want to see me sad or depressed
im such a person pleaser and im that in a way that i dont want people to get worried or upset over me or something that someone else did
its not fair to them
at the same time its not fair to me
why cant people just not rely on me too feel better
woo today was so fun my mum woke me up at like 1030 and was like hey were going to the beach today so get going
you know me in the morning
yeah i ended up using my ways and got dan to go then we all had to fit in my moms car
so it was joo in the passenger seat and harry me dan in the back
i liked the turns then we swam some walkedskatebordedswam morewalkedsat around more you know
it was an overall nice day though
i hope we have more like that ill prolly write later so bye
today was so freaking boring
remind me never to go over there when the guys are playing video games
hopefully tomarrow will be better
kinda like the lord of the rings trilogy
when you thinkhope that its finally over wham bam thank you maam it comes back with more shizzle to throw at cha
na na na na na
i think this is the second one of the day for me
its kinda ironic how much time i actually spend in front of this computer
but hey what else would i spend my time on
laying outside is a given
im prolly going to do that later
due to the fact i have a horrible tanline
im going down to harrys later
i havent talked to him yet today so i dont know when but i am
this is what you hum you hum
wont you come over you know that you want to
how does it feel to know i still want you why do we always seem to want what we cant have the ataris between me and you how fitting is this lyric snippit
i need to do something
i think i need to make a move towards the future
i was going to put a exclaimation mark there but its more interesting this way
we should do more of it
i also want to camp out in the backyard with the gentlemen
it would be so much fun
some people dont realize what they have
id enjoy having something like that
some people ill never get
i cant wait till tomarrow
ill get to go back to harrys
that means more than likley dan izzle will be there
after that last post i went to harrys house from like 6 til 1030 almost 11 ish
gotta love it over there
prolly write later when the rents go to sleep
took the boat out today
makes me miss the ocean terribly so
might go see john mayer and maroon 5
because it would be a free concert with the aunts in columbus
warped tour is in like a month or so
i cant stand to be bored but i am
i want to hang out with the guys
but id have to find them first
i also want to hang out with dan
but thats not going to happen without the other guys around
its not fair being here all the time
i wish i could just pick up my shiz and go to cocoa beach for like a week
have to find something to do
its over already i guess time flys when youre having fun
yesterday was so much fun atleast for the first part
all i had to do was take the world history exam then i was done
i passed it with a 97
then i walked to joos house and met up with him harry bob and maggey
so we all hung out maggey left at like half past noonish
then we all just kinda sat around trampoline watched bob play starcraft a few movies ect
then i called my mom and asked her if i could spend the night so of coarse she was like yeah of coarse
so she came and got me and on the way to the house to pick stuff up for later she was like im seriously debating about leaving your father and im going to look for an apartment in niles and ect
all while i was going to leave in a half hour to meet up with the guys
so i didnt let it bother me
then my dad called and was like flipping out on me
he was like i didnt raise you for 16 years to just run all the damn time and youre being such a dissapointment and blah blah blah
it didnt help i could of probably told you and made a bet on the fact that he was drinking previously to this as he always seems to do every single fucking night it never ends
i always thought he was the one i could stand the most now im beginning to take it all back
of coarse i was outside when i was talking to him they were watching tv inside so i was being polite
and the only person in the world who could make me cry in an instant decided to flip the fuck out on me while i was at joos house
so of coarse harry had came out too see what was wrong
i was sitting by the tikitourches that me and dan had set up and i was all like im not going to let it get to me ima keep it all bottled up but i think i had been doing that for too long because as soon as he went to give me a hug i lost it
thats the first time i really ever let anyone see me cry let alone comfort me
im really glad they were there though
because if they werent who knows what might of happened
so then we went inside after like a half hour of crying and comforting and then me bob and harry all sat down and talked for a while which helped so freaking much
i never knew people actually cared about me
why i didnt think that i could mean anything to anybody
learn something new everyday dont we yeah
yesterday was quite the rollercoaster ride of emotions and events
eep ill prolly end up writing later if the mother and father arnt yelling at each other again which i have a feeling they will just because they shouldnt be in the same room together
i dont know what im doing anymore
i really like him i mean i really do but am i just kidding myself is it actually capeable that the kid i like likes me just the same but also has the same mentality as i do when it comes to getting up the guts to making the first step could it honestly be possible you know tomarrow is the last day of school
and it doesnt feel like it
it feels like the middle of the year
on top of that things have been happening and shiz has been going down that make me want to explode
why i constantly put up with it all is literally beyond me
i bet you anyone else in my shoes would of had a nervous break down by now
i might loose a brother that i never really got to know
yeah cuz the dummy signed up for the army a few years ago and when lilly came along they put him in the reserves
dont you know that the reserves are being called out his group has already been activated
that scares the crap out of me
i dont want him to go
he has a kid he has to raise
hes got me his only sister and brothers to be around
and i still have one more final to go
people make too much out of nothing and some dont make enough out of anything
this worlds a crazy place and my mind has decided to run at its own pace
why cant i be the one as the center of attention its not fair for me to have to fight for everything when ive got nothing to show
am i not fighting hard enough or am i just going to be alone for the rest of my life i dont care anymore
you people dont care about what you put me through you dont care about what im put through you dont care at all
so you know what its time for a change
today was the first day of finals
i finished my algebra and took the first part of my french today
after i left and met up with chris and harry at the gazeebo sat around for a while there
then chris left and we decided that we were going to go and kidnap dan
so we went and sat under the big tree in the practice field and read it was soo nice out then we commandeered him went to joes had a water fight on a trampoline and then i came home
you know i wish that i would have more guts too get up the nerve sometime
i dont think he will ever either
but if he really wants something to begin between us im hoping he would say something

yeah i went and saw it with the gentlemen today
we went to the mall before for a while walked over to the theater and then we all recriuted back to bobs house after
the movie had some very nicely done effects and fight scenes
a few dry spots and some questionable things
like where does his web shoot too when theres nothing around him confusing i know
not sure what im doing tomarrow
im sure ill be wherever they are though
wanna know something i dont think that i have ever been home one day completly this summer
i love spending time with them
even when theres nothing to do and we just sit there making up stupid stuff
i hope i get some sort of a response from him soon
im so nervous and so confused all at the same time
maybe its a good thing hes thinking about it
so im not quite complaining just yet
well even though i have nothing to do im gonna go
ill probably write in here laterz
song yo check out my ride
the aquabats mood oak kay
i figured that since i had a blog and it was really depressing evertime i would go to write in it i would make a new blog that would be happy so here it goes
yeah since i didnt get much sleep friday night because we decided to be stupid and stay up all night and i didnt go to bed last night until 3 i was so freaking tired today
plus dad woke me up at 945 to go to breakfast with aunt kat uncle tom and grandpa
i got to drive home too so that was cool
then i went shopping with dad for a while after that i went to joes house and met up with him harry and ryan
i was hoping dan would be there since i need to conversize with him
i have nothing to really say since this isnt a bad mood blogger
wow i m so proud of the blogger people
theyve finally let us edit how we want our font to look
and to that ill applaude them
last night i went out to eat with the family and the aunt and uncleness
made me sad that i couldnt watch any of my videos last night since they lack the capeablities of dsl
i would hate the be them
i went to the movies none the less today though
went and saw mean girls
it was actually a very good movie
it really shows the truths of teenage labling and things like that
though at some points it was quite exaggerated but i think the whole point of films of that mannor would be to make it dramatic
i started to read brave new world by huxley
it makes you think yes i mean makes because in the book you have to learn everything that is going on
since it is about genomes stem cell cloning and human harvesting and it was written in 1932
almost sad is what it is
i mean we just cloned the first human being last year but a single man wrote a whole novel on it basically explaining the process back in the thirties
i also finally picked up the book rule by secrecy by jim marrs
ive wanted to sit down and read that book for a while now
its basically about conspiracies diffrent groups truths about mass media and things of that mannor
it will be a good read
marching band starts in almost a week more like eight days and my muse concert is in 18 days
its going to be the highlight of my summer by far
i guess thats all i have to say for now
robert miles children i didnt do anything today
some stuff that people said made me rethink everything
i hate when that happens
nobody ever comments in this thing
besides cups so to you i thank
i miss talking to a few people
im glad i started to talk to a few again
so im going to go
music muse falling away with you i was talking to a couple of old friends today
i hurd them talk about what they did yesterday about how they get up and go to church every sunday morning
ideas like that are just bizzare to me
how can so many people have that much dedication to one thing for so long now i can understand having dedication in something like that if it was say marraige school something along those lines but with that its always something new bold and interesting
doesnt the church feed you the same stories that youve probably hurd since you were a child im sorry but repeditiveness is one of my ultimate pet peeves
i dont exactly write off the theory of a greater power so to say but i cant agree with something that cant give me explanation and facts
id rather have nothing to believe in than believe in something i cant rely on and prove
the other thought is the thought of having someone have control of your life
i know that you say he doesnt control it he just gives you options
to me it sounds too much like a buisness
and i dont want someone else to have control of anything
ive always been told im my own person no one can dictate me
so id sure as hell like to live it that way
another thing not too far off subject but not exactly about the evolution objection and what not is the question of the end of the world
the apocalypse as it where
have you ever woken up in the middle of the night when its pitch black and not realizing its only 3ish and you thought the world was over what would you do in the last few moments for the brief moment of confusion i get paniced
i realized that i havent said half of the things i wish i would of and that i havent did half the things i would of liked to
but i know that in the few moments left i couldnt get half of those accomplished
thus feeling regret and sorrow
i think thats what scares me
im not scared of the apocalypse or dying for that fact
im scared of not doing the things i need to do or say the things i need to say
thats enough of my deep thoughts for you for now
im sure ill be back later with more
music zanzibar suburban legends falling without you muse so
i found out that laying down on my floor and setting the fan right in front of me on high with all the lights off and curtians closed listening to muse is very relaxing
i spent most of my day doing that today
tomarrow im gonna head up to the grove city outlets and do some shopping with the auntness
im so bored and tired of this vacation crap
i just want school to start up again
that way i dont have days like these where i just sit around and do absolutly nothing
today was a boring day
all ive done was walk down to harrys where i stayed for maybe three hours and watched them play kingdom hearts
a beautifully made game art wise but a bore to sit and watch
that kind of thing irritates me
we all cant be choosers now can we or just not me
if i find more to detail you about ill make sure to write later
but dont get to hopefull
yeah i sat around infront of the pc and wrote somethings
rather than that and cleaning up the house a bit ive just been here
hopefully this feeling will pass by tomarrow
if it doesnt then ill probably be worse off
im still extremly excited about seeing muse live in 27 days thats going to be the highlight of the year by far
especially since its a festivle they most likley have a meet and greet tent out
meaning i get to meet him
everything that happens is supposed to be and its all predetermined cant change your destiny guess ill just keep moving so they may be and one day i may get to where im going
nothing gets crossed out bright eyes
well i spent the night over at harrys house last night with the gentlemen
didnt do much played videogames ddr watched some anime
though we did walk to chinese earlier so that was good fun
i still have no word about that letter
kind of upsets me but there are signs of hope
since sarah had to pull out on me for warped tour its gonna be just me and pops at the annual summer concert of the year
and because he still has back troubles he asked me if i could look at another show
a damn good one at that
i found the curosia festivle with the cure muse thursday auf der maur interpool the rapture mogwai the cooper temple clause
live and in the flesh get to watch and meet because i will not leave that show without meeting him matthew bellamy play infront of my very eyes holy crap that will be so freaking amazing i might just die
hes my ideal guitarmaster and has the best voice i have ever hurd
out of all of the other amazing singers like ace enders brandon boyd and matt smasher
its going to be like woah
but the tix are expensive
so hopefully that will be a striking iniciative for dad to help me in my persue of meeting him
i wont leave until i have an autograph and a picture hehe
its only fair tho at this point i dont care about not going to warped
so for those who were maybe looking at going with me sorry but muse is definitly worth it to blow off warped for
well today was a fun but long day came home from aunt kats house around 930 this morning got changed then rachelness came and picked me up at a little after 10
went to marys house got party supplies opened my present thanks ladies then we coobyeyahed down to jennas and started setting up in her cabin
made many trips back and fourth
she was so surprised and the cabin looked cool hehe we dressed up in her little sisters play clothes that were like sparkley non fitting items and went to the movie store and pizza hut waved to people and got some interesting looks
o yeah and shes getting an underground pool oh my goodness she has some nice looking workers the shell necklace guy yea over all between the eating of icing the cake
me almost getting killed by rachel and humiliating myself in front of people
it was a good day
catch you on the dl
i woke up to the rents fighting
then aunt kathy called and rescued me to her house
i swam with emma and noah for 6 hours
i think i have chlorine poisoning because i dont feel good and my ears hurt
i came home and they faught some more
so i sat in my room listing to muse for a few hours
then ventured out into the living room to go online
i dont know where mom is
tomarrow will probably be quite interesting
goodness i have had nothing to do this whole day
seriously i went online for a few hours called bob because all of the gentlemen were over there and found out that they were all leaving in a little bit anywho
so i stayed home the whole dang day
fell asleep though around 245 until almost 6
im really hoping that tomarrow will be better
but who knows what everyone is doing
as of now im going to warped tour with just my dad which will suck for him because i go into the pits and i dont think he can
meaning ill have to leave him alone for most of the time that were there
that is so going to be boring for him
maybe i can find someone to tag along
because sarah was supposed to go with me until she found out she has driving and danceline that day
marching band starts in less than a month
26 days to be exact
im guessing that ill type more tonight
the boredom is effecting my communication skills
okay so i found the magical wonders of xanga and i must say theyve won me over
but i know some of you kids out there read this thing so for the hell of it ill update
so cups this ones for you
i think ill start by giving you the expo on wensday since it was rad and i heart it
we left the house at 330 and go there at almost exactly 5
it was down at blossom which was really nice
then i found out i couldnt of taken in my camera because they dont allow it
and because it was pouring we had to take raincoats
yeah it stopped raining about 20 mins afer we got in
then we watched auf der maur
the lead melissa is the exbassist for the smashing pumpkins
who in her age still rocked like a mother
i couldnt believe how rad she was
she is now my vanilla then we watched thursday who is amazing live
didnt expect that great of a job by them at all
plus it was the last day of the tour for them and they were filming a rock movie called gods lot btw second stage was in a parking lot
after that when everyone else left for a while i stopped by and talked to him geoff lead of thursday for a good half hour
hes such a sweetheart its great how he listened to me
i wish i had more people like that around me more often
gave me some good words of wisdom
i was so bloddy excited for them to come out
okay so the stage wasnt more than the width of a classroom
maybe a tad bit more
and where i was standing i was right on the baracade and i was in front of matt
who i could easily drool over let alone sweaty and with a rad guitar
so they played hysteria new born butterflies and hurricanes the small print and stockholm syndrome
i was a bit dissapointed because i didnt get to hear plug in baby so what i did was i yelled it really loud as they were still on stage and then the group of about 10 forigners screamed out was sounded like ploog en bahbay but it was just there accent
so they stopped looked at each other and came back on and played it
oh yeah after stockholm syndrome and after the riff thing they played after matt was on the ground right in front of me so when he stood up he was like hugs for everyone and so i gave him a big hug and kissed him on the cheek you only live once right and then he looked down at me and was like alright then and gave me a kiss back i thought i was going to die
but i didnt then we decided to catch the cure who by all means suck live
its like all stonerelevator music
so we left after the first 2 or 3 songs
it was like 1030 by the time we got out and we wanted dinner so we went to dennys where we ended up running into melissa from auf der maur talked to her for like 10 mins
then ate and came home
sound great yes it was
well im not sure what a blog is and so this will be me figuring it out as i go
lol of all things im in a pretty crappy mood tonight too
i have lots i should be journaling about and i guess i might as well work on it here
i used to have an open diary a site that is still near and dear to my heart
but that got compromised by someone and i took it down and then never had the umphf to start over
whats on my mind tonight
well what was on my mind this morning at work was this
he spent the night last night
that was cool always is very nice to be in his arms
to be aware of his warmth all night
i actually didnt sleep much last night
told him this morning that i didnt know why but i do know
i may only have 4 more weeks with him
4 more weeks to last my lifetime of having someone hold me and love me for no reason just because they do
i love the morning light shining on his face as he wakes next to me
his blue eyes gazing back at me with his soft smile
lying in the darkness just before sleep sometimes he tells me things
last week he drifted off in my arms and when i had to leave he woke and told me he knew he was falling
and i said i know
i held him for longer before i finally had to leave
the other night we were sleeping and he sat up in the night
sort of upset or sad
he said baby i just dont want to lose you
and i said so dont and held him and he fell back to sleep with me
its like his fears and heart show in the dark of night
and i know because mine do too
when we drank cider the other night
things started to be said that we feel
and are afraid to say
i still cant say it so much in words
i want to and i miss him so much tonight it aches
before the sun rose i looked over at him and he reached for me in his sleep and held me close to his chest
said i love you baby
i said i love you too
then i held him so tight
so much it hurt because i ache for him ache to tell him whats in my heart
ache to be with him and really give all of me to him
its ripping me open that in a month or so it may be over
what if it all changes
i know we can live through that
but thats not the point
i cant spend my life wondering what would have been if we had given this a real go
in my dreams i want to share a home to have him come home for dinner at night and to wake with him every day
i want to play our games and watch our movies and have our friends
i want to see what our babies would look like and take them places
to make pictures of us that match the dreams in my heart
how could i have known that he would be so much so soon and that i would never want to let him go
i think ill stop with that cuz i dont wanna talk about what i dont wanna talk about anyhoo
i awoke this morning in a foul mood
why i dont really know
i had become a little testy on the phone with my girlfriend last night but not enough to justify it carrying over to the next day
one thing i do know is it is setting the precedence for the rest of the day which isnt really surprising as once i get in a foul mood it is extremely hard to pull myself up out of the trenches of self loathing and hatred
ive been at work for the last 4 hours and have thus far accomplished nothing at least a lot more nothing then what i usually accomplish while at work
in recent times i have slipped from a model employee to the try to do as little as possible disgruntle employee reason being my boss recently hired a new employee and our office is turning into a good ole boys club where i being of the opposite sex feel out of place
i work at a university and have worked in the same department for the past four years my official job title is computer support assistant yet my responsibilities have grown much since i started gainful employment here
yet now im feeling under appreciated as the new guy is getting paid more than me and is perhaps destined in the near future for a pay rise just to stick the knife in a little deeper
you could argue that his job title carries more clout then mine as he is officially known as a web developer yet i as a lowly old computer support assistant should technically be paid less yet it appears that i have moved from the illustrious realm of shit kicker to web developer over the years yet i still kick the shit when ever someone is in
technically we should be on an equal playing field yet this too doesnt seem to be the case
because i have been here the longest i am given the added responsibility of maintaining our servers while my boss lays on a beach somewhere smelling of coconut oil and slowly burning flesh
but alas it is not to be i must suffer in silence i know ive not been very silent
i do however feel much better now after this little venture perhaps my foul mood was simply due to pent up frustrations which have since subsided as a result of this writing
i feel better now and perhaps well enough to do some real work
wowwwza fer real i have just been happy lately
like theres nothing to bring a girl down well a few but like honestly my life is amazing riot nio
for example yesterday i worked with jim and hes just really nice and i love that kid
then i could drive home cuz my parents were so thoughtful as to give me my liscence back
then me tess mart and clarr warched one of the worlds best movies dickie roberts former child star
and something as simple as playing a few games b4 bed just made the night complete
i went to bed happy and woke up in the night laughing bc sarah started screaming things in her sleep waking us all up
then in the mooonin i ate pop tarts which was a positive but the best part was emma was doing all of her dances for us and hannah was attempting them too
and then we hit shady izzoak
it just was one of the best spans of times ever
u know what i was thinking about tho just to go deep for a sec
having a boyfriend or a girl friend is so wierd
you pour your heart aout to one person and say all these things and do little cute things for them like go to their games or buy them presents or suprise them somewhere
but then like when youre done with them and move on to the next person you do it all again and its all the same
like you end up saying that same nice things and going to the same games only for a differnt person
like why does it mean anything any more
or why do ppl not get offended when someone askes them out
so the next time that a guy askes me out im going to start crying and ask them why they dont care about me
but seriously think about that
it makes you wonder the significance of your relationships
gatta eat and then coach wish my sistas team luck
k well last night was one of the funnest nights in a while
we took care of business on jennys tramp and we watched a few quality movies such as hollow man memento and small portion or rats
we had one mass coed sleepover which is just a positive step in a whole new direction
but the guys were just to with itwhen we played chuck or fuck but theyre new
i guess u could say
also avital sang a few songs which were amazing on the flipside she woke up the entire house at 5 in da mooonin
but honestly it was fun
next step sleeping in the shaggin
it will happen im calling it
oh and david wilkinson you owe me two dollars and do not deny it
u happen to make the same bet twice and yes you lost so pay up
oh and u spelled ur own name wrong in sarahs yearbook from way back in the day
ur spelled ur name wilkonson
ok i really dont know what to say im so conflicting
a part of me really wants to just blow up and write this nasty blog about something that happened
because i felt like i was about to throw up for about
a couple hours last night
like i try to tell myself that i dont care and its not a big deal and to move on and like ive been trying to psyche myself out for like the past few weeks but i guess im not doing a good enough job
but like it really isnt that big of a deal and i dont even know why im wasting ppls time writing this
i think its not that big of a deal to me until im really there caought up in it then it means the world to me
i hafta go im helping coach my dads soccer team baby ttyl
i forgot a crutial part of my day
now i want you to honestly say it out loud just cuz its fun
words are the words with the accent in the sentece
its just cool cuz it kinda changes what they sentence means
say it with me i will see you in the morning
i will see you in the morning
i will see you in the morning
i will see you in the morning
i will see you in the morning
i will see you in the morning
i will see you in the morning
thanks guys that was fun ill see you in the morning
2day i visited augsburg played nintendo with quaile and buyas i worked with yossi and jamie hmm and hung out with the jew kids
it was a hot one
oh and claire broke her phone
45 minutes with that phone
lets all pitch in some money and buy her one of those clips the one that attaches the mitten to your jacket sleeve and clip one end to her phone and the other to her face
the shaggin last night was a grood
time david did manage cover his face in wax
typical david forgot that the candles would eventually overflow with wax and he was lying on the floor under one of the cornershelves and all the wax flowed off the shelf on to his face
it was a beautiful thing
oh and we did have a hard core card fight and yes i took every one with authority
but honestly the shaggy waggy looks emaculate everyone should check it out and david would like the company
it would give him something to do other then make out with his sister
moving on i have the thought of the blog
lets say u have a friend or a lover or someone who talks about a past person
like a friend talking about an old friend or a lover talking about an old lover
and they talk so like lovingly about them
and like how they miss them so much or like they were devistated that they couldnt see each other cuz they moved died or broke up or something
well do ever wonder if they are thinking like that about you like so u arnt frinds with someone ne more or like arnt dating someone ne more do u think that they are having those same feelings about you like are they upset cuz they cant be with u ne more or was that one person they were talking about just amazingly special to them and u dont mean nething to them and they havnt thought about you since
i guess that whole paragraph was saying that i wish that i knew if ppl were thinking about me the way they thought about other ppl or like im thinking about them
like if i meant ne thing to them
cuz maybe i thought of them as a best friend but they only thought of me as someone to hang out with when they were bored
well its 1 in the morning and i should be hittin the sack
i am going to bethel tmrw im leaving at like 130 call me if u wanna hit that with me
hewlow alright well big news about the shaggin almost being done it does look hot ill admit that
umm survive it and drive it just finished about an hour ago it it was stupid
they gave both of them cars bc neither of them were going to stop
see that just ruins the fun but we floats ur boat
they did go around about 1500 times and really thats sick
if ne one wants to come to colleges with me hit me up cuz im getting lonley
im going to gustavus this morning im going to one tmrw and 2 on friday
oh and come and visit me when im workging 2nite and tmrw 49
ok so the feeling of the blog
this random feeling that was pissing me off is the sudden not caring feeling
idk if ne one u have felt that but i bet that u have
its like u think that someone really cares about you or something that ur doing and then when ur done then they just kinda
and u wonder if they really cared that much earlier or if they were just kinda doing it bc they had to like if u guys were dating
and that just sucks and makes u just feel not cool
but its okay ive found things in my life to make up for it for example claires car
i have never been sad when im in claires car she always has a happy mix or good things happen in thurr
so moral of the 10 second story if ur in a pissy mood hit up claires car
alrrrizzite gatta bounce beyatch donde esta la biblioteca pedro aya
ok so this one is going to be dedicated to lying becuase i think that its a problem that has infested ppl lately and it is just not cool
im not saying that everyone lies xcept for me bc i do it too
but i just want to say that a lot of the lying that is going on right now is really hurting ppl for example a witnessed a lie that took place about 20 minutes ago and if it were me on the other end i probably would have cried
like ditching ppl isnt cool
ill just leave it at that
and i just want to give a should out to the ppl who build on other lies someone is always going to find out no matter what
anf it is only going to get worse
there is no way to live a lie for your entire life bc eventually its going to come up again and its only going to be 10x worse then
so just stop being stupid and just admit what u need to say or be mature and talk about it
bc if ur lying ur obviously trying to cover something up which really should be talked about
were all mature ppl here so like if were me i would have so much more respect for you if u actually laid it all out for me and i would realize that u are being the bigger person and in the end i would later thank you for that
so thats a hint for all those ppl out there u are not talking to be because its really bothering me because not talking to someone about it is as bad as lying about it
im sorry im just in a bad mood right now bc so many ppl lied to me tonight are lying to mo over a spread out amount of time or are lying to eachtoher
aye aye aye im not sure if u would understand but go to jason mrazs website and it explains it very well but seriously guys the boys gone home oh and we died claires hair today its like a light strawberry blonde it looks good
hit me up if u want ur hair died
well i have a lot say considering i havent blogged since the day b4 the euro exam
but i decided to start over with a new blog and like vow to blog eaerry day
tonight was a good night we went over to alainers and we just partayyed it up like no other it was a lot better then sitting in the wendys parking lot for the entire night ill let u know that one from some past experience
oh and today was good
we redid the friggen shaggin
there are no words to describe what we did to itbut it just looks amazing ill tell u that much
and its going to bet better once we put in the shelves and like put that gold shia all over it
this day would have been the best day ever except for the fact that davids mom spazzed on us because there was a few rolls of tp in his trees and he was to spoiled to clean it up but im going to put that behind me and move on
but guys remember if u do it again you are no longer welcome in our house i was talking to byers about 12 hour ago about this and he told me to blog so here it is
ok well im saying that ppl make it really hard to figure things out
like things never work out the way they should in the first place and then once they get screwed up other ppl who dont really know what they are talking about make it so much harder to fix
rumors get started ppl talk behind other ppls backs and ppl shoot other people
im sure ur all thinking about a specific situation that is going on right now and thats not what im talking about im just talking about problems in general
like if things just went bad and only the people who were involved knew about it then it would be so much easier to fix
but dont get me wrong not all situations
like if ur getting stalked by a crazy old lady wearing overall shorts that likes to go walking at 2 in the morning then please talk to the police or something
but like about all the dramathat happens
i think that we should all be like buddah and let it flow
nothing matters bc whats happened has happened and u cant do ne thing to change that
also u cannot change how ppl are feeling bc if ur changing ne thing its not what they want
i hope u catch my flow
that rule of thumb also goes for the ppl that are involved with it bc trust me youre going to waste a lot of time for nothing bc no matter how hard u try its still going to be what u dont want
yes i am the univeral bubble breaker but i needed to slap u in the face and make sure u knew that b4 u wound up in that situation
im just looking out for you because i love you i love you all
except for david because he called me fat and then made his mom yell at me and if u dont listen to me and end up being screwed hit up either me or mart for the top 10 bible verses to know that we got they really help for like every situation
ok well im sorry if that first blog dissapointed you but there are many more to come
goodnight everyone and as the amazing alex byers says 2morrow is a new day love that guy ehhhwwley
i have many things that i have been thinking about lately
nbsp one being why its so easy to say that u dont care about someone when youre not around them but then when ur with them u take it all back or its so easy to say that u hate someone or that u just want to never see them again but then when u see them u would kill for them to even talk to you two being why is it that when u have no authority or right over a person you still feel like that are yours like u know that u have no reason to but u get insanely jealous when someone else is with them and hes not giving his attention to you and u cant tell anyone because u have no reason to be feeling those feelings because hes not urs
like why is it such a big deal when u see him later laughing with someone else or when he casually puts his hand on someones hip just in a friendship way
why is it that in a realtionship one person can love someone with all their heart and soul but the other person doesnt even mind that much when the relationship is finished like it doesnt make sense
also do u think that it is possible that every one has someone out there in the world for them but when u find them maybe ur not the person for them their person is still out there
like is it possible to find someone that ur meant to benbspwith andnbsplove so much that u could never love anyone greater but then that person isnt meant to be with you nbsp i hate thinking about things like that
me and tess just kinda got on some of those topics and my mind was still flowin so i had to blog
if u have the simple answer to any of those qs
just email them to me
nbsp me and rowdy are working together tonight 4cl come and visit us nbsp striz
well as u all have probably guessed by the title of this blog i am having a coed sleepover with the universally loved alex byers
he apparently doesnt want to sleep by himself in his house so my dad was like well theres an aero mat in the basement and that was that
nbsp right now were just chillin and its just cool
today i went to the crosstown club with sarah and then i rollebladed around the lake by myself cuz sarah wussed out
then me and tess went to byers house bc there were about 40 cars outside and his door was open
but really no one was inside and he had just stupidly left the door open
me and sarah like snuck all in thinking that they were like hiding from us too but really
then later me tess cdub byers and clay chilled in the long lot
and then byers is sleeping over
its been a grand day
nbsp nbsp have u ever experienced i time when someone is talking to u about a time that u two had together but u dont remember it and u think that the other person dreamed it
like u know that it was a dream and its just really funny well that just happened to me
ill just share that great experience with you all mattgonewild04 make sure to bring those sexy pajamas the ones i love those sexy sweats
what sexy sweats mattgonewild04 u know damn well remember when we went to ur house and then u went to change and then u changed into those sweats and u looked super fine assed in em hckychica06 i think that was a dream mattgonewild04u changed into gray sweats wit sumin written on the butt and a dark burgandy red shirt hckychica06 i dont own pants liek that im sorry man it was a dream mattgonewild04 no way i hate u so much ally it was so sexy

lol nbsp well that about wraps it up im going to the driving range tmrw
it will be a grand time
peacenbsp nbsp aballaby nbsp u want to come to the pants party are u asking me ifnbspi want to come to a party in your pants
oknbspso i realized last night how mean ppl are to each other
like its not a lot to where ppl notice that much but when you sit back and look at it people are just plane mean to each other
i also noticed last night how nice clarsky dub is
i think that we should all just take a leaf outa her book and just try to step it up in the niceness scale myself included
and we shoudl give her an award
nbsp wow im excited for 2nite theres a rumor that a busfull of ppl are going to grand slam and thad be wicked awsome
i havent been there yet ever
nbsp greatest 2 moments of my life yesterday getting off of work at 930 when i started at 2 listening to a mix in byers car from the summer b4 7th grade nbsp it was hot nbsp well i gatta go to work come visit me were open til 7 nbsp ewl
it feels like it has been a hella long time since i blogged
or blogged about anything of importance
right now i have my friend over brittany shes my moms best friends daughter but now her and my sister and her friend carrie hoppman are playing mario cart and i got shafted
man i had fun last night
me tess claire clay travis dave and byers had a tramp party and we all watched claire jump retardidly i dont know why she looks so funny haha
but travid protected me and others in his boobs which are massive
we climbed into his cleavage
it was a good time
no but so everyone leaves to go home and likei swear that i had my phone
but then i went inside and i couldnt find it later
so i assumed that i left it out on the tramp
so i went back and got a flashlight and looked on the ground for about 20 minutes and couldnt find it
then i went inside and gutted my room incase i threw it in there and guess what i didnt find it so i went to bed thinking that my phone was ont he ground outside getting all full of water and morning dew and then i had a few nightmares and then claire called me saying that she took my phone home in her purse
it was a beautiful thing
thanks claire for making me one hour deprived of sleep
jk i love this sat class its full of 12 hot junior guys i want to announce to the world that i have overcome a large barrier in my life as of yesterday
it took a lot of cold pricklies to make it happen but i got er done
wewell i hafta go play nintendo
peace holla i dont know why we are yelling
loud noises the best movie ever striz
attention this goes out for you
seriously theres something bout the way you look tonight theres something bout the way that i cant take my eyes off you
theres something bout the way your lips invite maybe its the way that i get nervous when your around
and i want you to be mine theres something bout how you stay on my mind theres something bout the way that i whisper your name when im asleep oh no
maybe its the look you get in your eyes
oh baby its the way that makes me feel to see you smile
and the reasons they may change but what im feeling stays the same
a tired and sad ally
member that song no fer real its been like a week and a lot of shia has gone down
lets have a large and in charge replay right b4 i left claire and byers were at my house playing board games and reading about how marykate is addicted to drugs until like 1215 and then i still had to finish packing
then about 10 minutes later i had to be at the ariport at 6 in the morning to catch a plane to mass for a hockey camp
day1 it was tight cuz we just kinda chilled at our coaches house and ate a lot of food and watched van wilder
and we got our hotel room and got all settled and shtuff
day2 we were woken up at 615 for breakfast and like an orientation that me and brando were late to cuz we were buying little toy boys lacrosse sticks
then we got our clothes that we had to wear always and then we skated edges and stuff and split us ito groups
i guess by watching you skate on your ourside and inside edges they can tell how good you are at hockey
and i got shafted cuz i haddnt skated in 2 months
then after skating we had plyometricsif u dont know what those are just think jumping
after that i dont really remember exactly what we did but somewhere in there we skated 3 more times and had 3 more drylands b4 being shipped back to the hotel at 930
day3 it was our first real day and it was the longest day of my life
i was amazingly sore from the day before and honestly couldnt walk
but regardess we had 4 killer hours of skating with a wicked long run in the woods by the arena in the rain
like it wouldnt have been that bad but then we ran by the steepest hill that u have ever seen and our coach made us slide down it
little did we know that we were going to sprit up that beyatch thousands of times until this 14 yearold like collapsed on the hill and then we dicided it was time for us to run all the way back
after that it all blurred together
day4 2nd real day and at this point i was so sore that when i tried to get out of bed my legs gave out
it was a horrible experience
but it was worse trying to put my pants on bc to save my life i could not pick up my leg to put them on
so i ended up sitting on the bed and using my arms to pick up my own leg
also the highlight of this day were the slide boards
if u dont know what they are they are like a sheet of plexiglass that u slide across with little booties on
it seems fun but its not
i reached a point that i had never reached before
at a point my legs gave out at the end and honestly i could not get up
im lying on this plastic sheet in a puddle of my own sweat trying to use my arms to lift myself up and at that same time about 130 coaches and councelors surround me and are screaming at me to get up and are like hitting the walls and floors and im just wiggin out
i thouhg i was dying
i think i was becase i dont remember ne more
xcept that we skated for the same 4 hours and had thesame drylands
oh we did have the stabillity balls for one dryland which i got a kick out of
day5 our last real day
it was just like the onthers xcept for that we had a scrimmage for our last our of skating
and and durring the day we had this like crazy kickboxing thing
the lady who ran it was the beastiest ladies i have ever seen
she was really into the whole thing
and it was wicked tired after it it was 2 strait hours of lots oj jumping and football running and punching air
it was funny cuz everytime we did just a normal jab we had to say the person we were imagining that we were punching
it was a good time
i bet u are all wondering who i was punching
annnnywayy day6 this day all i can say is parachutes
talk about pulling the groin muscles
but that was about it
oh and i met some really cool ppl there
ill just tell u the ones that reminded me of ppl here this girl names leah who was the spitten image of meg ben carlsons older sister i swear this girl could have been brandon bs sister this coach who was an older adam galililiililii
hmm and the cool ppl were the one girl that was called corey that i thouht was a guy for a while and my roomate called gardner but with a boston accent it was gaadnaa
and i heard the song coolo about 20 times along wiht freakaleak
it was tight as hell
well this is a wicked long blog just about camp i think that ill come back tmrw after church and blog fer real
night all minnesota that was my name at camp along with strick
i just got home a little bit ago and im glad that i did
im just in a damn good mood right now
ill just give u the good day run thru right quick woke up at 1030 byers picked me up at 11 15 and we went to the twins game
we did happen to miss the only scoring of the game but it was okay because byers made up for it by buying a foot long beast of a hotdog
and he purchased my ticket
twas a grand ole time went to work and had the best time i have ever had there
me and yossi had some deep convos and i dont think that i have ever laughed so hard
when we get fruit its put in this huge plastic binthing and put in the freezer for when we need it
so we needed it today and we had no idea how to get it out of being a giant frozzen rasberry ice cube
we sat there in the back with huge butcher knives just stabbing the thing and then using a plasic spoon put the shavings in another bin to use
meanwhile we listened to the jason mraz cd four times
eventually we were covered in melted chunks of soggy rasberries and we had spilled the giant icecube on the table
after that im not sure what really happened
all i know ids that i had to clean it up then i went home changed and drove to clarsky dubs house
just in time to say bye to ppl and to take byers home
but really we didnt go home but had our own partay and picked up te we went to baker square and then partayed in the long lot with a hardcore qa session
i blogged sad everyone is leaving and i feel that im never going to see anyone again
i really want to have a giant calander of when everyone is leaving and coming back cuz right now im flappin in the breeze here
i havnt packed and i have to be at the air port at 6 in the moonin at sat
i have some work to do
well i will bid you farwell if i be just for the night or for the next couple of weeks
come visit me i work tmwr 4cl night lovers al
honestly alex byers is the best person ever
like no matter what negative thing i say he always has something to turn it around
i could say that i hate the way the state of new york is shaped and he could tell me that maine is in the process of selling a chunk of land to ny and in the end it will look differnt
hckychica06 but it pisses me off like all the fricken love stuff baseballa964 well aweewlo that is why u dont get involved like that baseballa964 u get into really great friendships baseballa964 and u just love life with ur friend baseballa964 and as far as tappin goes baseballa964 i am always an option i love this kid you dont even understand
and tmrw we are hittin a hot twins game it will be a big day
and im working tmrw with yossi 4cl everyone come and visit me no but reallyi had fun 2nite at avitals we played the question game which is fun like always and just chilled
we did leave at about 1145 and i got hom eat like 1230 we just got hardcore lost
like not lost just missed every possible exit and such
over the last 2 days something happened that made me extremely happy and something that just made me want to throw up again out of like
so if u think that u did the thing that made me happy please do it again for my sake and if u think u did the thing that made me want to cry and enter into a feedle position try and avoid it or at least around me
well im off to bed and i hate it
why do u always dream about the thing that u cant have and is the last thing that u want to be thinking about
after a dream dont u wake up so happy that u finally got it but then u realize that it was all a joke and u get to either go out and see the harsh truth in the real world or go back to bed and have it happen all over again
who ever said that dressup was for little kids was stupid
cuz im proud to say that in this last year alone i have played dressup at leaste
no seriously i think like 5
thats kinda embarrising but i wear it proudly
i think the only person that should be embarressed is clay cuz he just looked stupid or more likea beastie girl as i stated earlier
oh and claire u looked like u were on every drug possible
i want to bring to everyones attention that in the last 3 weeks i have seen david
ok i was gone for two of those weeks but i have been home for like a week and i have seen david 1ce
oh i forgot hes too busy with every girl in the sophomore class my bad
david i thought that we had something like we had some sort of connection
we went rollerblading around the lake together that meant so much to me
sniff moving on boobtag was fun last night
but its one of those games that no one wants to play cuz u can never relax the whole night
ur just reaching acrosse the table for some popcorn or sitting down minding your own bizznas when
but it does keep everyone on their toes
by the way who is it ok this goes out to someone in paticular but im not going to say who
i just want u to know that u mean so much to a lot of ppl more people then u think
u make ppl laugh and feel really good about themselves especially me
you mean a lot to me and if anything happened to u i would be devistated
and i know a lot of people that feel the same
what ur thinking about would not help anything even tho is seems like its only logical thing to do in ur case
i bet thats what she thought too but it didnt help a thing and think about how it made u feel and what it has brought u to considereing
it would just bring more people to to feel what you are feeling right now
it woudl make everything worse
so many people love you please know that
please at least think about what i said
no if i were to serisouly blog fer real about eveything that i have been doing for the last 2 weeks u would be reading for a bout 5 14 hours
and i can pretty much skip church camp cuz i bet stess had some wicked blogs about it
but i can always brush on some highlights anyway lake geneva csi
im so obsessed with knitting i decided i needed a spot where i could track my finished projects muse about future projects and generally go on about it all without being a drag on my regular journal where i get to be boring about my life as a mama instead i thought id just post pictures of my projects thus far starting with my first scarf last november which i made along with armwamers with no pattern for a little family friend however my son silas is modeling them
they were made with some cheapy lion brand chenille since i was deathly afraid of ruining good yarn and i had yet to discover the many amazing yarn stores seattle has to offer next i made a couple facecloths for my sisters for christmas i cant recall what order i made all of these but i made them in december 03 and january 04
the kids scarves have no pattern nor does viviennes hat but silas hat is hot head from stitch n bitch as is my kerchief next came my booga bag my first attempt at felting
i used noro kureyon 126 around the same time i started a sweater for silas
i only just finished it so ill post pictures as chronologically as i can manage
i also started the little black top from stitch n bitch for my sister and a felted hat for my other sister
the hat is made with cascade 220 black and a dalegarn wool purple held together with a sparkly bit of something i bought off a cone at my lys
next i decided to make a little spring top for vivienne
i used patons fresco and loooved working with a ribbon yarn
it was a nice break from the little black top
somewhere in there i made a spring shawl out of plymouth eros for our coop preschools annual auction but i cant find any pictures
i did finally finish the little black olive top and it fit my sister perfectly
it was my biggest success to that point
i had a huge sense of accomplishment
here is susan showing it off i needed a major break from garments after that but my addiction forced me to goof around with some spare yarns i had
so yeah a beer cozy that was pretty dorky but it did inspire a little thing i consider to be pure genius dont pretend you dont eat it out of the pint then webs had a huge sale and i got a steal on some closeout cascade lana doro
i started the under the hoodie again from stitch n bitch
im still working on it currently working on the first sleeve but heres a view of the back after frogging the sleeve once i got sick of it and put it away for a few days
well of course i couldnt not knit so i seamed up silas sweater at long last and that my friends brings us up to today still plugging away at under the hoodie having made numerous stupid mistakes on the sleeve and having had to frog it twice
next up is knittys cleo for my other sister helen
im also planning on a cardigan by kristin sperklund from the interweave free subscriber patterns for viv but i have yet to buy yarn or anything
i need to start thinking holidays too okay
thats it for my first foray into blogging c
i finished another tiny ribby tank except i changed it up a bit crossed the straps in the back and did a 3needle bindoff instead of kitchener to graft the straps
this one is for my friend js little cutie
hopefully she will send me a picture of c modeling it now onto cleo for real
look at this yummy yarn it came today for cleo for my oldest sister
im so pleased she decided to order this yarn
its soft and the color is amazing
kinda splitty but i think ill get used to it
and for the first time in my personal swatching history my gauge was spoton the very first try i love elann
i got a good price on the yarn and i received my order in two business days
im excited to start it but i think i will finish up tiny ribby tank 2 first
heres vivienne in her new tank poser she immediately pulled like crazy on one of the straps stretched it all to hell
i washed it on warm gentle and it looked really messed up upon coming out of the wash so i now have it on delicate tumble dry with hopes its not ruined
a livejournal friend recently knit this cute tank for her daughter and i was inspired to make one for miss viv
i happened to get some uberclearance lily baby cotton so this cost me seriously less than 3 to knit
i had to learn kitchener stitch which sounded easier than it was
actually the execution wasnt that hard but it doesnt look that great
i need to figure out the trick to making it look nice neat i guess
anyway overall im pleased with the top
the very middle stripe is leftover variegated cotton i had from some dishcloths
it looks much better in person than it does in the picture
its obviously too late to have v model it so i will add a picture of her showing it off tomorrow
these quickie projects are very satisfying to instantgratification types like me
the yarn arrived for my sisters cleo halter
it isnt quite as it appeared on my monitor
i guess theres the flaw in bargainhunting online
i think it will work out okay though
thats the next thing on the needles and i will work on my hoodie here there too
i really want to make a big soft afghan too in hopes my husband will finally get rid of the holey sunbleached monkeyvomitgreen one hes had forever
i made the umbilical cord hat from snb for a friends new baby this evening
its nice to know theres a pattern i can just whip out in an evening when friends have babies its creamcolored despite looking white in the photo
such a nice easy thing to knit c
so my ice cream cozy was featured on cozy of the week
if you want to knit one too heres the madeupasiwent pattern on size 5 us double pointed knitting needles cast on 48 stitches join and divide among 3 needles
knit 3 rows in k2p2 rib
add in scrap novelty yarn and knit however much you want with that
when you are about halfway done k2tog after the sixth stitch on each needle
add more eyelash or whatever as you see fit
about 34 way through do the k2tog decrease again
for the next 2 rows k2p2 rib then cast off in rib
the last row should be the bottom of your cozy
im thinking after i finish the second sleeve im going to put my hoodie aside for a bit
i need to knit the umbilical cord hat from stitch n bitch for a friends new baby then i think ill knit up one of these cuties for viv
i got some lily baby cotton for next to nothing today at joann since my store is moving and they are clearing everything out
i think it will work well for both the umbilical cord hat and the tiny ribby tank
its not so beautiful outside today and t i were out late celebrating his birthday last night which leads me to think today would be a good day to sit around and knit
unfortunately im really sick of my hoodie
i cant start vivs cardigan since im waiting for the yarn to arrive
i cant start cleo for my sister because again im waiting for the yarn
i guess i will just tough it our and work on the hoodie
i just want to be done with it already
i should look through my stash to see if i have some random cotton to make viv a little tank
so the new issue of knitty
people are all aswirl on the various knitting communities
people seems to feel strongly
i think some of the stuff is cute though i am more inclined to make things i can show off i guess because im still newish and it feels like such a giant accomplishment every time i finish a piece
i am considering making hush hush
i might wear it in public actually
im thinking a silvery grey with black and hot pink ribbon
ohh maybe ill knit the top in black the rest in the silvery grey and pink ribbon
if i do im sure it will take me ages
i can see it being something to have perpetually in progress when i get sick of scarves hats and sweaters over the winter and then voila next spring id have a lovely little nightie dress
time to vacuum and do dishes then i will hunker down with the sleeves to my hoodie
i finally got through the lace band its really a cool pattern once you sit down and do it with out smallchild interruptions i expect ill finish the body today and then i need to go back and make another triangle
its a little dark and its squished onto the circs but you get the idea
whats next i am going to finish off a big bad baby blanket for my friend langus who has thrown in the towel
then i need to decide whether to focus on a bag for me ive got some lambs pride bulky in black and a nice deep pink waiting for me to knit felt
i have a cardigan i want to start for viv
i need to go back and add the hood to my hoodie
and then theres xmas presents
im pretty sure there will always be plenty of projects awaiting me from here on out
cleo is slowly killing me
ive ripped out one of the bra triangles twice
i got sick of that so i moved on to the lace band and guess what ive ripped it out not once not twice but ohhhh 5 or 6 times ive lost count
i need one full evening of total silence to get the lace band done and done right
if i dont get it right next time i may throw in the towel and come back to it next spring
i hate when knitting sucks
well here i am all alone nobody to talk to
i think ill make this a place to write my poems even though i suck at writing poems coz im more of a story writer
well since i have nothing better to do i will write a poem now
yesterday you didnt have a clue yesterday i seemed a little blue yesterday the truth i thought to tell yesterday my life was a living hell
today youre there with me today my life is filled with glee today the truth is told for you today i still feel blue
i may have come out but my life still troubles me
a little weight is lifted but theres still so much that hurts me
i still have to get used to the fact that things will be different
but even if they are good things it makes me uncomfortable
my parents act differently they think things that are wrong
ive always been like this and just because i am who i am doesnt change the reasons for the things i like
you who read this may not fully understand what i mean youre not like me but one day it will be better
i just wish to be happy
forget ur trouble come on get happy you better chase ur cares away
lol i like that song
p funky fun and stuff bye bye
i rushed my english work so much today that i lost my really detailed front cover and forgot to draw an important diagram inside it well ne way who has used an electric roulet game that zapps your finger well i have and i put both my fingers in it creating a full body circuit around my arms causing me to be highly zapped 3 times in a row well ne way
actually i dont know what comes next
finger nails dont you just love finger nails theyre great
i could talk about finger nails all day long theyre really handy when u r opening a can of drink and when you need to scratch ur bak if finger nails didnt exist i wouldnt know what to do
they can also come in handy when u r trying to get barcodes off products that u hav just bought
usually they just end up ripping though if i could turn back time i wouldnt change a thing but even in my prime my heart forgets to sing
secrets hidden so long have stopped me from myself and when i find me soon ill prop me on my shelf
thankyou and goodnight youve been a gr8 audience
everybody shake it time to be free amongst yourselves your momma told you to be discreet and keep your freak to your self but your momma lied to you all this time she knows as well as you and i you got to express what is tabu in you and share your freak wtih the rest of us coz its a beautiful day sexual revolution ne wayz now that im beginning to get over that song i thought i might do a spot of blogging alexs hot topic 1 always wear underwear no matter what youre wearing over them coz sum1 might dak u i have a joke alexs joke 1 knock knock
mary christmas sorry that joke was in a little kids winnie the pooh christmas cracker and it made me and my friends laugh alot not that we found it funny just how stoopid it was once upon a time there was a boy called boagle he went to horty torty primary skool he was sooo silly coz he constantly fell in a hole well this one time he had just arrived at skool he walked into the grounds and fell in a hole
and then he went and played downball but the ball hit him and he fell in a hole so he went and fell in a hole
and then he went to class which had a hole in the doorway and he fell in it the end stay tuned for more boagle thats all for now babau from akira alex yay woot
ok ok in my last blog which was a few minutes ago i forgot to give a hot topic and a joke and i forgot to write the next installment of boagle the boy who falls in holes
so here goes alexs hot topic 2 what ever you do never and i mean never put your face at the entrance of ball returners at amf bowling
coz you never know when a chicken is going to hit you in the head i mean a ball not a chicken alexs joke 2 what did the elephant say to the giraffe how did you ever get so tall and thin while im stuck in this fat heavy body i know i know it isnt funny and really its not a joke
but i didnt have any on hand adventures of boagle episode 2 it was the weekend and boagle felt like riding his bike so he went out the back and fell in a hole
then he got on his bike and fell in a hole
he rode around the block three times and through horty torty school twice
then he sat down and fell in a hole
so he sat down on a grassy knoll
he got out his sandwich which was actually a hole and he fell in it
so he went and fell in a hole
on his way home he fell in a hole and then he fell in a hole
around the corner he fell in a hole and in the driveway and at the door and in his room
so he came to the conclusion of watching where he walks so he immediately
stay tuned for more boagle

krystal yuk poo head ne hoooz
have a nice day and a wonderful life babau
woohoo shell be here tomorrow which probably means i need to clean the place up a bit uh oh since jens going to get a car well be able to at least grab some furniture so shell have somewhere to sit and she has timed it perfectly for the pool opening on the weekend
while im slaving away in work she can lie by the pool and fight with the cicadas got my hdtv cable hookup unfortunately the ondemand function seems to have broken in the meantime so i have to get out early again today so someone can come look at it
on the brighter side of things techie i managed to blag two 1u dual piii 866 machines for free ill swap the mobos out into a more reasonable case and hook them up at home no idea what ill use them for yet but im betting that theyll munch a few seti units in the meantime while i figure it out
one last thing where the hell is the alt gr button on us keyboards it annoys me to have to type alt0128 for the euro symbol and then have to remember what the code is for accented e etc
i know i could change the keymap to uk or whatever but i shouldnt have too how about an alt gr option or something end of rant
thats right this is the week jen arrives on thursday and will be staying right through to the following sunday yay also on the good news front i now have cable tv broadband and a new mattress
on the notsogoodnewsforjenny front i still dont have a bed frame a couch or even something besides the floor for her to sit on
on the other hand that does mean that she will have plenty of reasons to do that favourite female pastime shopping and with someone elses money no less always the best way to do it
should be getting a few rack mounted dual piiis gratis from the job too will be nice to play with them maybe set up a beowulf cluster or something else equally difficult to configure after all ill need something to do with my spare time when jen leaves
ill be getting bot a new mattress and cable tvcable internet on saturday
the prospect of digital cable with hdtv and a 3mb cable connection makes me drool should be cool though i still need some furniture a desk a couch a coffee table etc
the place looks so bare without anything though the stacks of dvds books and cds help a bit so shelves are on the list of things to buy too
at least the tv works as a monitor so ill be able to actually able to use my cable connection when i get it
hopefully the next post will be from my g4 cube hanging of a 3mb cable connection
my stuff from ireland arrived this morning so i now have all my cds dvds clothes etc
unfortunately i have nowhere to put them on the bright side though i did get my new tv
not a bad price either
plan is to use that for now and them wall mount it in the bedroom when i get my bigscreen tv later
ive been looking at some of the 50 to 60 dlp screens but i cant decide at the moment
my phone should be hooked up tomorrow which just leaves the cable to go fingers crossed ill be up and running by monday its always nice to have a 3 mb internet connection got a nice aerobed to sleep on for now my mattress has been ordered and should be here on saturday
no word on my bed frame yet though cant win them all i suppose
ive decided to document my little adventure in america
my previous attempt at a blog httpadam
org has fallen by the wayside somewhat but i think with some of bloggers extra features i should be able to rectify that situation
besides all that it will give me somewhere to moan about the red tape infested wold you end up in when you immigrate into the us these days
anyways on with the blogging after nearly 6 weeks in the country i finally have a new place to live right next to reston town center
the rent is reasonable and the big bonus is that im within walking distance of the job which is good given how hard it is to get a drivers license in the state of virginia when you were born outside the us
go take a look at the requirements pdf for yourself and try to figure out how many of those documents you might have
it turns out that the only thing i can use to prove my identity besides my passport is the i797 form i got when applying for my visa
not too bad you might think but then i applied for the visa in january so my memory of forms i obtained is a little hazy
it was only when i got desparate and started googling every form listed on the sheet to see if i could get one that i found out i had the i797 already
once i get the learners permit its just 30 days until i can take the test that should be just in time for delivery of the new car other than that things have been going pretty well
im finally going to learn perl tomorrow properly this time too not my usual half assed attempt the company are paying for an intensive 3 day advanced course it would be nice to know at least one programming language properly
most importantly my lovely and far too good for me girlfriend is visiting in a couple of weeks all i have to do now is make sure there are things like a bed chairs tables in the new place before she comes
another trip to ikea is needed methinks
thats enough for now more when i get bored
not so much from the what happened point of view as from the thank god its over point of view
for some reason i was shattered this week i essentially passed out around 9 p
on wednesday night and slept right through
then my bloody ankle started to act up just when i thought it was getting better
on the plus side i found the excellent dia program which should do as a nice replacement for visio who needs licensed software anyway the ic department in work finally delivered the linux box i ordered
theyd imaged it with redhat 9 but i didnt like the way they had the disks partitioned and i like to stay a bit more current so following a plesant experience with fedora core 2 on my laptop i installed that instead
the box itself is a decent spec considering they gave me whatever they had spare its a 2
4 ghz p4 dell not bad at all
now im going to watercool my shuttle system so it stops making so much noise
annoyingly it looks like i might have to replacethe ram in that system seems to have developed somenasty errors every time i try to view a windows media player video on it the program crashes and games work for about 5 seconds
strangely enough quicktime seems to play fine so maybe its a directx memory addressing issue or summat
well now that things are settling down a bit i find i have a bit of spare time on my hands
i have plenty of things on my todo list but ive got some stuff done
first off i have kicked off the transition of comerford
cc to php nuke
i wont be using dreamweaver to administer the site anymore because i no longer have a license for it with the change of job hence the transition to a more web based management of the site
you can view the initial template here nuke site
in fact now that i have switched jobs a lot of my licenses are hosed photoshop is gone too not to mention windows xp pro i do have an xp home license but why bother
there was a time when i would have just kept on using them illegally but thats over
usually i can find an alternative thats free and usually open source so thats what i intend to do just for kicks heresthe list and the alternative windows xp linux currently fedora core 2 but that may change dreamweaver phpnuke bluefishquanta photoshop the gimp firefox same just on linux thunderbird same just on linux fedora core 2 is currently running happily on my little sony r505dl laptop and all of the bits and pieces besides the scroll wheel which i never used anyway is working
ivealso managed to get an rss feed to work on php nuke by converting the atom feed
i put a little guide up on how i did it here atom to rss
so left on the todo list install linux on the xbox build out my two other dual cpu boxes and get them up and running linux design a new theme or use an existing one for the nuke site and theres probably more ill dream up along the way
woohoo i got my learners permit this time i got every question right though if id had this test last time i would have had no trouble then either just the luck of the draw i guess
now all i have to do is learn how to drive before my car arrives next month yesterday was a pretty good day all round in fact as well as the successful test the pistons destroyed the lakers
since i had 20 euro on the pistons at 81 odds i was pretty happy a fact that i am now paying for since my happiness inspired me to drink 7 or 8 beers oh well
so no going out for me tonight have an 8 oclock start in work tomorrow and i need some sleeeeep
just realised i never mentioned the new chair my lazboy arrived on saturday and im glad tosay it rocks on the bad side of things i managed to fail the theory test on the virginia drivers license exam so i have to retake it tomorrow
grrrr whats annoying is that i needed 20 correct out of 25 and i got 19 the last question was how much more likely you are to have an accident if you are drunk 5 times 7 times 10 times or 12 times
how the hell am i supposed to know that so i went for 12 times and got it wrong pain in the ass
at least i can get another lift down to the dmv early next week
guess i better get studying
finally got around to installing linux fedora core2 on the laptop it is working quite well i even have wireless networking going on it using the netgear wg511 card i bought a while back nice also have the bare bones for 2 new systems one dual piii 1ghz and one dual piii 866
the second one will be donated at cost to mr
irwin who has been good enough to drive me around the whole time and populate my apartment the other will be my default filewebwhatever server on my home network
since it has raid capabilities i should be able to come up with a nice fast machine havent decided what to run on it yet bsd or linux
fedora doesnt seem too bad so far gentoo is a possibility if im bothered putting the time in then bsd is as stable and secure as it gets hmmmmmmm
anyways back to watching the basketball after seeing england go down to france tonight a pistons win would be the icing on the cake
yesterday wasnt bad in order to keep myself busy i cleaned the place up a bit moved a book case to where it is going to live permanently relocated all of my computers to the new desk fitted a modchip to the xbox and fitted a half length pci graphics card to my qube whew at least now i can use the nice shiny new lcd that i got from iiyama rather than the television
next thing to do is get linux probably gentoox working on the xbox
not because i need another box but because i hate it when companies like m try to dictate what you can and cant do with something you bought
on the bad news side my lazboy chair which was going to be delivered today will have to wait til saturday they picked the one time to deliver it that i absolutely could not make it home so much for a 4 hour delivery window
roll on saturday at least my bed will be complete by this evening im working from home at the new desk so i can accept delivery of the base
jen left last night and it was 10 times worse than when we said goodbye back in the old country at least then i had all the excitement of going to a new job a new country a new apartment etc
even the fact that my lazboy recliner is coming tomorrow cant cheer me up
its dmv time once again this week too which does nothing for my mood though hopefully theyll at least accept my application
last thing i want is to have a nice shiny new car and not be able to drive it
anyways i cant wait for september when shell be back then all i have to do is help her find a job here and she can stay heres hoping
my apartment now looks like someone actually lives there my dvds cds and books are up off the floor though not arranged in any meaningful order yet as soon as the desk arrives should be tomorrow ill post some decent pictures of the whole thing
the only disaster was the cd storage unit i got from ikea i put it together after having a few drinks at 1 a
and managed to essentially put all the shelves int he wrong way so that the screws are visible uh oh
anyway once full of cds you cant see the screws so not too much of a disaster the sofacouch is ordered too now all i need is a lazy boy and im sorted should be going to the lazboy store tonighttomorrow night to take a look at the options there
of course none of this would be possible without the arrival of my lovely girlfriend who can drive while she is here
shes also pretty nifty with a screw driver and allen key right now i believe she is amusing herself in leesburg outlet mall while i slave away in work
speaking of slaving i better get back to it
unfortunately it sems that my webhosting company has gone tits up
net no longer resolves they dont return emails and their phones are disconnected
looks like that is that
because i recently lost my back up of the site i have lost most of the content too a few exceptions are my blog obviously and a couple of pages i found in the google cache
ah well i suppose the site needed to be revamped anyway still it is incredibly annoying
ok i knew that the whole atkins diet low carb thing was big in the us but i was still surprised when i got here at how pervasive the whole thing is
im prepared to live with it because lets face it most of us could stand to shed a few punds me definitely included but just now i saw an ad on the tv it was for a low carb dog food from pedigree that is taking things too far i mean sure i got a great laugh from it but it is getting ridiculous if your dog is too fat the take him for a walk more often duh
decided it was time to flex my coding muscles this week so ive put together a little tool that converts ip addresses urls and host names into autonomous system numbers and gives a few other little tidbits while its at it too
it can be found here as number tool of course it can be found on the old homepage too
it all came about because i couldnt find anything to do this for me needless to say theres a command line version that i use personally too
now most people reading this are probably wondering what the hell an autonomous system is well first off id like to clarify that i mean an internet autonomous system not a mathematical one
to use a poor analogy think of them as the country codes and area codes used in the telephony world without them you wouldnt have long distance calling because the exchanges and switches would have no idea where to send your call to
well as numbers are something like that in the internet routing world
go to wikipedia to learn more about them
went to see spiderman 2 last night have to say that i liked it didnt have the fun of the first one when you were learning how they were going to implement all the superpowers and stuff but still good none the less
some soppy bits to be expected in a blockbuster these days but the effects were good and the action scenes were well put together
special effects werent as jaw dropping as the day after tomorrow that i saw last week never has a film with such a weak story line been saved so well by special effects in my opinion
oh and ive found out that ill have a choice as to where i can watch the euro 2004 final
theres a bar in arlington summers and if im too hung over theres always comcast ppv
the site has been downslow for the last couple of day no idea why and im too lazy to find out
hence the reson for the lack of new entries i have confirmation that my shiny new audi a4 is on the way to the dealer and everything is in motion now all i need is that license
unfortunately i have to wait until 15th july until i can do the test since theres a 30 day waiting period before you can take the test
still at least it gives me a little while to learn
i may need the full license to get the car registered and released to me too which is probably a good thing having the car parked outside the apartment and not being able to drive it would drive me nuts
hopefully ill know today or tomorrow exactly how much of a dent this will make in my finances too
with insurance the downpayment the initial loan payment and sales tax its adding up pretty quickly
fingers crossed the up front total is under 20000 anything more than that and ill have to put off buying anything else for a couple of weeks like food for example back to work
i got a letter yesterday from audi financial saying my credit application had been turned down
naturally this frightened the crap out of me and it was too late to contact anyone by then
thankfully it was all a false alarm the letter was generated by accident and everything is fine with my car again hopefully i can get my license by next week ive booked an appointment for a test for next friday yes i know its the 13th which gives me another week or so to get everything down which should be plenty
now theres a change from ireland no 9 month wait to take a test
picked up the new car yesterday i still cant drive it without a licensed driver in the car too but that should all be rectified soon enough
pictures can be found here
on the techy front i finally managed to get some of my content back up following the urbanisp disaster
the how to flash a firewireilink dvd page is back people seemed to find that helpful so im happy i got it back
most of the other stuff is hosed however
i cant believe that im actually making another online journaldiary thing
the last time i had one of these i was in 7th grade
seems a little immature to go back and make one
but like i told matt i enjoy typing a lot more than i like writing
i remember back in middle school everyone who was anyone had an online journal
i still dont really get why people write about their secret issues like they would in a private journaldiary online on a public journal thing
doesnt really make sense to me but hey
im doing it arent i anyway
i remember i had my online journal till the middle of 9th grade then after two incidents i decided it wasnt worth it anymore
the first one occurred at the end of my 8th grade year with one of my close friends at the time teresa she moved away up to west palm beach
she obviously had an online journal as well and was actually one of the people that talked me into starting one
well to sum up teresa she was never the cool cheerleader that everybody liked or even the nerdy art student who everybody knew but pretended not to
she was apart of our little click at school that everyone seemed to stay away from
and of course people always made fun of us for the way we dressed and the music we listened to
it was so immature but i guess thats middle school
its funny cause i look back on it now and i think to myself
god damn was i a fat little idiot
and i see my sister going through the same fazes and changes that i did inat her gradeage wow thats confusing to look at
anyway so we were all made fun of a lot and whatever
so teresa writes about it in her online journal
and i think this was all about one or two years after the columbine incident
and shes writing in her journal that shes gonna get these kids back before the end of the year and blah blah blah
but of course all of us know she means just like make fun of them behind their backs because thats teresa
she doesnt have the balls to walk up to one of them and hit them in the face
or for that fact bring a gun to school and shoot everybody up
so somehow somebody in the school reads that entry and decides to turn it in to the school board
and of course my journal has a direct link to hers and vice versa and i wrote stuff like that too in mine so im not the little innocent angel either here
well we are both brought down to the office and blah blah shit happens
they talked to us about the seriousness of this situation and all that other garbage whatever
in the long haul teresa gets expelled and i get suspended for like a day and then my dad goes down there and raises hell
and well thats the reason teresa moves up to west palm
i feel kind of bad sometimes cause we promised we wouldnt lose touch and i guess we really havent but we arent nearly as close as we once were
i think that might have to do with the fact that shes doing drugs and drinking now but whatever
well that pretty much sums up the first incident
the 2nd one happened with my first girlfriend
the summer right after 8th grade i meet this incredibly hot girl in my neighborhood through my friend at the time johnny who is actually her brother
she was such a nice person to me knowing that i had never had any past experience with girls or anything
this was the girl i lost my virginity to
the sick part was another girl was involved
that was the one weird thing about jennifer is that she was bisexual
she had this friend who lived down the street named megan who was such a little whore and she was only 14
i think i was like just turning 15 so i guess im no better than she was
and megan would come over and just hit on me non stop
i dont understand why i was so fat and stupid then
so anyway we dated for about 3 months and then she broke up with me for some bogus reason i forget why
i was completely devastated by this too being my first girlfriend and all and the girl i lost my virginity to i was pretty fucked up by it all so anyway
i knew the real reason behind it
it was because she wanted to date other people cause she was a whore
so yeah i wrote about it in my online journal
and i called her a whore in it and blah blah and how we had sex in a threesome with another chick blah blah
and im guessing she knew what the address of my online journal was cause she showed her new boyfriend at the time who was this 6ft tall in shape knew martial arts black guy
yeah bad news for me written all over that description
well i used to ride the bus home back then cause i didnt have a car and freddy hadnt moved down yet so i couldnt ride with him
so one day i get off the bus and he for some reason rode our bus that day
well i have my headphones on and im walking home and this guy decides he wants to fuck with me
he gets in my face and i take my headphones off
this dude doesnt say anything he just hands me this piece of paper which i find out later is my diary entry
and when i look down at the paper i look up right after and he fucking hits me in the face
he fucking sucker punches right in the face
me never being in a real fight before only instances with which ive punched a kid out and held one up against a locker with one arm i had never actually been in a fight with another kid swinging at me fell to the ground like a ton of bricks
woke up walked home with a swollen face and that was that
i never saw the kid in school again though
i wasnt sure if he transferred or whatever
and jennifer ended up moving so yeah
those are my two reasons for not having an online journal anymore
i ended up writing a lot more than i had intended to
well anyway till next time
ate breakfast which lyn made for me and amanda
it was goooood then went swimming and then i went to work
nothing exciting happened at work so im gonna flash back to yesterday which actually was fun and im gonna retitle my entry right here
also im going to speak in the tense as if it were yesterday
my fun day with matt today was awesome
i really need to hang out with matt more often
i love it cause even if we dont do anything if we are just sitting around we always find something to talk about no matter what
if its music movies video games
the only somewhat not enjoyable part of the day is when roxy and manda decided to come over and have a sit down talk
which we found funny because i had suggested it earlier before they came to do something like that later in the night
so we all sat down and tried discussing everyones feelings on everything
i kind of think it may have helped but then again
its easy to say something like that wont happen again but its a lot harder for it to not actually happen
well after that we all decided to try and patch things up by having a quick lunch together at taco bell before parting our seperate ways
after that matt and i went over to circuit city to check out some games that matt was thinking about buying cause he heard that they were selling them for cheap
they ended up not having any that he needed so went over to look at the music section looked around there for a while where matt spotted a three disk deal for only 20
he bought it and then we left and went over to target
he got the stuff he needed and then we picked up amanda and drove around looking for something to do but ended up just going back to his house
stayed there till we had to go pick up jason and then we went back to matts and played some video games
it was a very enjoyable day
im hoping wednesday will be just as fun cause thats my only other day off this week
im also really excited about next week though
i get to go up to port st
lucie to visit my cousins who i havent seen for like over a year or two
the only downside is that my moms living there now and its gonna be extremely gay
i love the mouse its awesome
what a shitty 4th of july
i guess it wasnt too bad
except for the awkwardness between certain individuals
of course i had to ditch work to have this fun day and for that i got bitched at from my dad and had a guilt trip given to me from my manager
then me amanda roxanne matt and courney drive down to matt harpers house to light off fireworks
that was actually a lot of fun its really funny how afraid of fireworks amanda really is
after all that we me and roxanne really decide we should go down to the beach and alex decides to come along too
so we get down there and its great the waters so warm and me and roxy give each other this look of oh god we wanna go in so finally we do
i actually took my shirt off
and i somehow talked roxy into taking her pants off
all she had on was a pink thong
i felt bad for looking since amanda was there but she has been pissing me off lately
well to make a long story short matt doesnt come in cause he doesnt like the beach to begin with and then of course roxy and amanda call him antisocial and all that he gets pissed blah blah everyone ends up pissed at each other
then we drive back and amanda decides to go with alex and roxy back to his house and leaves me home by myself cause i had to be home early because of my dad fucking god she pisses me off sometimes
i dont even know why i listen to her
she only ever thinks of herself
of course she always does the lovey duvey shit
oh i love you this i love you that
but thats all it is
she can never compromise a situation
its either her way or the highway
and she wonders why i get pissed off sometimes
ive gotten to the point that i just want to punch her in the face just square in the fucking face just so she would stop talking or laughing or whatever she was doing at the time
i wish things were the way they used to be when we first started going out
but i guess everybody wishes that from time to time
she doesnt get how things work sometimes though
if i ever make her feel bad for any little fucking thing im a dick
and then all this drama with matt and roxanne
that did a lot of fucking good now didnt it all matt wants to do is make everything out to be his fault i keep telling him it isnt but he just wont listen
and then roxanne just doesnt understand why things happen when she does stupid shit
its like amanda in a way
just she sometimes thinks things through a bit more
ugh i love them both though i really do
i dont think i could think about life without them as friends
even though i havent really known either of them for very long i feel so close to them
i just wish they could get past this fucking
i havent felt this way in almost a year
having so much shit on my mind that i just wanna cry 247
of course thats a real pussy thing to say but who cares
no one reads this damn thing anyway
first my mom decides she wants to come back into my life
and of course my asshole dad constantly getting on my case all the damn time
then theres the pressures of money and thinking of how im gonna pay for college
what college im gonna go to
i dont even know anymore
now all this other shit with two of my best friends and more frustrations from my own girlfriend of a year
i wish this thing would give me some kind of feed back for my problems
i guess that kind of defeats the purpose of a journal though huh i mean in a real book one you wouldnt get any feed back
im done writing till next time
so today was pretty damn uneventful
i had to wake up early this morning to go down to my dads old shop in north miami
the place is called aamco its kind of funny that even though my dad doesnt actually work there he can go in and use the shop for whatever he wants
and the guy who owns the place still pays him 150 a week
for no reason well there probably is a reason since my dads a fucking gangster he more than likely owes him money or some shit and hes paying it off slowly lol
so im there till about 1130am then my dad asks me to do him a favor
he hands me 10 and tells me to pick up my sister and her friend from the house and then drive down to sheridan street
which is like a good 10 minute drive one way and i was exhausted to begin with
the really shitty part is that on the way back i got fucking lost
and then it starts to down poor
like cats and dogs down poor it sucked
i ended up having to call my dad to figure out where i was
i hate the highway sometimes its not descriptive enough
like one sign will say north but the street youre already on is going north
and then theres no other sign saying that the road you are on now is going to start going in a completely different direction then the one you were going in
its so confusing maybe im just dumb
so anyway i get home take a nap and go to work
and work is fine no problems lots of conversation not too boring
but when we close chris comes up to me and tells me my fucking drawer is 6
i dont understand how that happen its never happened before
well good news is we made a tip cup that night and i made 3 so i gave him the three and he said he would cover the rest for me this time
god damn did that suck lol
and now i have to hope that i can somehow talk rich the new general manager at the store into not making me come in tomorrow wishes self good luck welp till next time
god damn it this is another major reason why i hate writing online
because if you have a shit computer like i do and it freezes when you are in the middle of a very long entry
youre fucked cause then you lose everything you just said grrrr well i guess ill just sum up everything i said before
basically i was saying how friday nights suck because usually i have to work
and then i went on into how i get confused with my thoughts
mostly due to the on going struggle between good and evil inside my head
i guess it wasnt all that much
but it seemed like a lot since i went into such deep detail
fuck it thats enough for right now
maybe i will write later
i heard about a couple of jobs at work i applied for the other day
i didnt receive an interview
im pretty dissappointed about it i thought my application was quite good
i was never expecting to get either of the jobs there are people at work who definitely deserve them more than i but it is still a sensation not dissimiliar to a kick in the teeth
all my friends rallied around to make me feel better but of course when you feel like that there is very little someone can do to help
its a matter of stewing for a few days and then getting over it i am becoming a master this year it seems
i offered my application to my friends at work for there opinion they all said it was pretty good but i only got a truly honest opinion from one my good friend anthony he told me that while it was good i used passive language which they warn you against i really appreciate his honesty you have to respect it
i think he might be one of those friends you meet rarely that you should try and hold on to for the rest of your life
you cant waste a good friend
i actually feel the bunch of guys ive met in the last couple of years while working where i am are the best i have ever made they are not like some of the friends i had in high school who seem to use when appropriate and forget you at other times and i honestly dont think they ever thought about it or the friends they are unwilling or just unable to share any emotions deeper than a bottle of beer with you
at some point you must grow up
i was told by anthony the other day when he read this for the first time that adnd is an old acronym for dungeons and dragons dating back to 2nd edition and that diehards upon reading my first post would pick me up on it
and i have to say if that is so then you really must start doing something more than dnd with your life okay i love the game but really
my wife just walked in and placed a big bag of pistachios on the table next to me
i usually buy a handful when i go to play adnd with the guys playing adnd is nice
no actually its awesome fun very geeky but hell what do i care what matters more in the world than enjoying yourself with good friends not much that i can assure you
negative energy dont we all have some of this within i would think we would have to considering all of it that surrounds us
is there a way to completely block it out and if so will it make me a happier person
you see i am a fairly happy person
i enjoy laughing and being silly and letting the inner child in me come out to play every so often
so last night i and a few friends were having a little get together
ya know some jokes a few bottles of wine couple hands of cards
well i had heard this news story on the radio earlier in the day that just made me think
so let me enlighten you guys on this rather odd and extremely disgusting news tidbit that fell into my lap while driving
in some state that im unsure of last week there was a dentist who had his license taken away from him for injecting his happy juice into the mouths of his unsuspecting patients telling them it was a dental rinse and then asking them to swallow it
well apparently a few of the poor women this happened to knew what it was they had just tasted and got together and sued him
upon a search of the dentists office they found several syringes in his desk drawer full of said happy juice
yuck ok so the point to that was
my boyfriend walked in the room where me and my friends were all hanging out after he had come out of the bathroom and wiped his wet hand on me
triggering me to think ewwww he just wiped pee on me which then triggered me to think of the news story i had heard earlier cause it has to do with bodily fluids
so i tell my friends the story mainly to gross them out as it did me
then this guy we will call him john
not my friend starts telling me what a negative person i am and how he doesnt even listen to things like that because he doesnt allow negative energy to consume him
okay i am thinking john is a complete fucking moron
i was just sharing a news story
then he goes into how he has this forcefield around him that no negativity can withstand
to quote him it would be like a spitball hitting an airplane
what the fuck dude by this point everyone is confused now and they all we all just keep saying huh huh what im confused
sometimes i just do not understand where people are coming from
maybe someone reading this will understand where he was coming from
if so let me know
i would like to start out with a little explanation as to who i am and why i have created this little corner of my world
although i feel like who i am will probably reveal itself to you readers through these blogs more than i could ever explain
so on to why i have created this blog then shall we i stubbled across this the other day while taking a little break from work
you see i always read the real worldroad rules blog spot
i just love both of those shows it truely is an obbsesion
so somehow i ended up here and i thought to myself this would be a neat thing to do
i can truley express real feelings on all kinds of subjects and the worse thing that will happen is no one will read it
i also could use the typing practice and learn a little more about my computer also
so i am going to learn as i go hopefully i wont do too bad
i do feel like i should tell a little basic history about myself though so here it is
i was born in birmingham alabama where i grew up living a twisted version of a somewhat normal life until i was 16
at that age i got married yes i know married at 16 lives in alabama i am not that stereotype
though i do meet all the qualifications and stayed married until i was 19 and living in tampa florida
i left my husband and came home to alabama
then i met someone and left for cleveland ohio where i resided for three years and returned back to alabama at the age of 21
for the past five years i have been living with my boyfriend in our house here in alabama
i have had all types of jobs and many reasons for the choices i have made
some not very good ones i will have to admit
however i would not change a thing
i am mostly happy with the person i am today and where i am at
i do fight innerbattles constanty it seems and struggle with the state of the world and the people in it among many other things
i do not want to overwhelm anyone so thats where im stopping for today
one of my favorite topics
its there cuz i had always been intrigued with it
and the intrigue ceased when i decided to try it out
but it wasnt for fun
i felt like i had no place to go
nowhere to hide and felt as if i had been left alone in the world
i wished for people who were true
not just people who seemed to care
i was tired of being with hypocrites
besides i had been having other problems and felt as if i had nowhere else to go
so it felt better if i could just disappear
to cease with this unnecessary existence
and it felt like a good idea at the time
and yes i know the obvious questions
didnt you ever think about those who love you
well i did think bout them
but i they had decided to continue living it was their choice
and either ways they would continue living
so i felt as if i didnt make a difference in their existence
if they kept living it was their problem
and if i had decided to stop
it was my problem then
so i was stuck with it
and i didnt want to have any more problems
so i just wanted to get away
and even though it seems stupid now
it felt right at the time
i was gonna kill myself
at first i thought about a gun
but then again not that easy
where the hell could i find it
so i gave up on that one
and then there was the knife idea
after the first cut no blood came out
well not as much blood as i wanted
well as i needed to die
so it didnt work either
i took right about 100 pills
but that didnt work either
it just seems they made the effect they should
but for a very long time
and i felt snoozieor whatever for like about a week or so
then i realized i hadnt been snoozie
i had achieved my goal
i had ceased this existence
thats when i realized it wasnt worth it
that suicide wasnt worth the trouble
but tried to make them better
not ran away like i did
i got a chance to know how my loved ones were
how they reacted when they saw me dead
i had emotionally destroyed my family
my friends felt as if it had been their fault
and i tried to talk to them
i tried to tell them
it hadnt been because of them
i was just not good at that time
and that i felt sorry
but sorry didnt make it any better
sorry couldnt bring me back to life
cuz there was nowhere back from where i was
at was in the middle
not in the beginning neither in the end
i was stuck in the middle because of my decision
a decision that had marked my life
happiness that had faded away
that had left my side
like had left my loved ones side
i was there i saw them
but they didnt see me they didnt feel my presence
but here i still stay
watching how everyone went on with their lives
and now it remains as my problem
but unlike the ones i had when alive this one can not get better
once again on my mind that simple desire for something that only time can bring
or maybe that accident ive always dreamed of
to die doing something i love
or just walking down the street
all alone leaving nothing behind
no one to cry for my death
for the way i just left for my own will
i had gone because i wanted to
i wish it would be as easy as it seems
i actually dont care where ill go after death
it doesnt matter where my destiny shall take me when im gone
as long as i was gone
as for what i believe
anything is better than being alive and having to be right here
as if there was anything left for me in this world
anything worth that so called limited time god
as if he was real jajaja gives people is just shit
at least for me it is
if anyone could ever want it
its not like im gonna use it in anything better
i feel as if i didnt need it
as if there was no use in having to live
and am gonna die anyways
so why not just do it now
some say life toughens you by experience
but i dont want to get any tougher
take this away from me
take my life where i cant ever find it again
put it in a box
lock everything i once had away
i dont want it in me anymore
i want to feel nothing
just to be empty inside
so that i dont have to go through anything that could harm me
there is neither happiness nor unhappiness in this world there is only the comparison of one state with another
only a man who has felt ultimate despair is capable of feeling ultimate bliss
it is necessary to have wished for death in order to know how good life is to live
standing there in the middle of the night
all tied up inside because of her problems
no one to save her from what she was becoming
losing her self in the atmosphere
loosing her self in no ones dreams
loosing her self in between
trying to find her way
trying to find a place
a spot to stop hiding
start facing what was going on in her life
to start realizing nothing was alright
and it was never going to be
that she had lost it all
i walk down the face of this earth alone
i am holding no ones hand and no one is behind me saying keep on going or keep on moving
when i stumble when i trip no one helps me up
i have to get up myself
in that dark cold night
staring right into those eyes who had been watching me as i walked through that dark
those eyes that had watched me
all the way through the forest
thats the only reason i saw the eyes on the first place
i felt watched ever since i entered the forest
but i didnt want to look back
so i just went on
i got lost and looked all around
but i stopped in the eyes
i could only see some little shine on the
i looked into those eyes
but wasnt scared at all
those eyes seemed to be admiring me
but as i looked at them they drank my essence
maybe too slow to notice what was happening
to really know that i wasnt ok
my essence was taken away from me
because i got lost and looked into those eyes
those eyes took all my essence
they took all that made me
i said i had enough
its senseless to be fed up and still have to be
never thought i would end up here
its that kind of happiness that simply exists and is there for no apparent reason
that happiness that becomes confusing after a while
but that day it was stranger than ever before
yeah great but then again it had no explanation
and i wasnt just happy like any other time that happened
i laughed at everything and it all seemed great
what the hell was happening to me
i mean not only the happiness
i mean not only that there was no reason
but that even though i was happy it didnt feel good
but the day went on
as for my conscious side
then i woke up on this room with cushioned walls
what the hell had happened last night
why was i in a mental hospital
what did i have a straightjacket on
what the hell was wrong with me
then the doctor came in
he told me i had been killing people
but that i wasnt just killing them
he said i danced with them
told them how happy they should feel to finally understand the meaning of life
that they should be as happy as me
all those days i had felt happy i had woken up in a police station acussed of inappropriate behavior towards other people
trying to take their lives away
the day i realized that happiness just wasnt meant for me
it wasnt meant to be
id prefer being condemned to a life in depression than a minute of happiness in which i ended up killing people
taking their lives was what made me happy
but being stuck in that white cushioned room took all the happiness away cuz when insane
its better to just do what your mind tells you
thats all that went through mi mind at the time
to live on to continue with this torturing existence
to live on in this pathetic side of the world
the only reason i had was you
and you in my mind always
i had to get over the place i was forced to live in
i had to become someone
be something to get to you
to finally get to be with you
cuz i find myself in you
i never thought that i wouldnt hurt
i really thought it would
i thought the pain i was about to feel would change what i was
the pain of the knife the pain of death the pain of suicide
theres no pain at all
watch as my life fades away from me
watch me as i stand there
bleeding like i never had before
the life that i had once had was fading away
and it was through the blood
living by myself living in a world made for those sociable
i went the wrong way around
im not a good part of society
cuz i dont feel like part of any kind of society
not because im a bad person or anything like that
what happens is im not the same as everyone else
my things that make me feel good
but that seem weird for the rest of the people
im in my own little world
cuz i dont have to be like everybody else to be happy
i just have to be me
time stood still as i tried to trace my way in the fog
ive never been so lost
ive been trying to find my way for so long
but now i guess where i am is where im supposed to be
i was home all along
but home doesnt feel good
im stuck in this war between what i am
and what i want to be
and what i want to be just doesnt make me feel better
but its where i am and what i am
who cares its just me
there i stood in front of my fears
but it was just to much to take
actually im not entirely dead
well my body is alive
well its too long to remember
i believe people see me alive cuz its like a burden a have to go trough
day in day out of having to be in this fuked up place
who cares if my language is inappropriate
youd say the same if you had to live here
to have to go through this
i wish i could die entirely
i just exist because i have to
theres nothing more to it
and i wish there was just nothing
but death cant be controlled by the human hand
suicide just doesnt make it better
but not bad enough to look for you
id rather live a life alone than spend 10 minutes with you
id rather talk to myself
anything is better than you
i wish you had never existed
never had come into my life to ruin it
i wish i had never been your friend
cuz i was a true one
you were just like any other hypocrite
trying to get things out from me trying to know my secrets to then make them public
betray me like any other bitch
im better off without you
and im glad to realize what you are
just keep it in mind
that place where you see those you loved in life
but dont seem to be able to get close to them
to have any kind of contact
but it doesnt feel like death
you dont even know how death actually feels like because you had things in the world of the living that you didnt do
no sense in trying to go back
cuz theres no way back
to be just like mine
to like the same things i do
to come and save me
to take me away from where i now am
to save my soul from me
to take me away from where theres no way back
from where i cant escape
i cant seem to find you
and i cant search no more
exhausted of trying to find the one that will never come
now i realize im alone
left somewhere in between what is usually called good and evil
left in a place where i have to decide where i wish to go
but i dont even know what i want
but being where i am isnt better
the cold made me shake
i couldnt find warmth anywhere
i put up a fire
turned on the heating system at home
even made some hot cocoa
but i couldnt seem to get hot
or even a little warm
so i decided to go out
find another place to stay
maybe at a friends home or something
the cold made my life miserable
i was staying at a house in the mountains
but not that far away from some friends place
the road had been covered with snow and i had no idea where to go
then i heard a noise
it came from the trees
i went there and found a little girl
i tried to talk to her
to hold her so that she wouldnt feel cold
i stayed besides that tree
maybe someone would try and save her
but she didnt seem to be looking for anyone
she didnt seem to want to go anywhere
suddenly she pulled out a knife
but not any kind of knife
it was one of those hunter ones
with all sorts of edges
and then she did it
she stuck it in me
but no one was there
all she said was she needed to quench its thirst
and had lost the strength to move
who just said she needed to quench its thirst
then when she saw me almost dead
since i made this decision it has been controlling me
this feeling hasnt left my body
and it will never leave
but theres just nothing i can do
but at that time it felt better
it made me feel better
i cant live without it
i just cant and im sorry
im sorry you had to be the one who had to fulfill its need
at that time i felt some strength coming back
and i was totally confused
what was that girl talking about
she looked straight into my eyes
i wanted her to answer fast
she said she couldnt tell me
i begged for an answer
all she said was if she told me she couldnt let me die
and i tried to smile
to please tell me and save my life
but she said it had been because of that intrigue that she was where she now was
lost and trying to escape
she said shed rather let me die
so that i didnt have to go through what she was going
but anything felt better that death at that time
and i told her i didnt want to die
she said she had warned me
but that it had been my choice
and i was going to regret it
by making me drink my own blood
but i felt no more cold
the night was the same as the one before
but i only felt strong
the cut the little girl had made me
it had even healed off
what had she done to me
what had she turned me into
seeing as i has stronger than i had ever been and the cold didnt bother me
i began to look for her
then i felt this urge
but i wasnt like the average vampire
but i also needed the meat
i remembered the little girl giving me some she had saved from another body
and made me feel strong
stronger than i ever had felt
even though i knew it wasnt normal
i went looking for someone
while i was hunting i looked into my pockets
same as the one i had been cut with
it was perfect for what i needed
and i found the perfect victim
whos car had broken down
i was looking at her
from in between the trees
she looked at me and asked for some help
i said id help her
but the need grew stronger
i couldnt even act as if i didnt want to kill her
so i just took the knife y stuck it into her stomach
same as i had been the night before
i wasnt like that little girl
i didnt ask for the woman to forgive me
took her into the woods
i woke up the next morning
but my conscious wasnt clean
i had killed and eaten another human being
but i was no longer human
i didnt know what i was
but there was something in me that had changed
and now i understand what the little girl had been saying
how i was gonna regret making that decision
now i know what it was
and didnt know what she was feeling
she called it the urge she felt
the need for human flesh and blood
and now theres no way back
eating other people makes you stronger
strong enough not to die
and now i have to live with this
without having the strength to control myself
and im not like any other cannibal
theres something more to it
something that cannot be explained
something thats stronger than me and that has taken over me
that took the human away
and turned in the beast
then again why am i ten feet under
that simple point where reality is a dream
a simple memory that comes back to torment our soul
a place where no one wants to go back to
a point where everything seems worse that it is
everything makes sense and it all sucks
you stand in a point in which everything you do has a consequence
everything takes you somewhere else
all of this shit that doesnt exist when dead
a stage in which there is nothing
not even a back stage crew
just trying to find something that wont come
searching for a reason to continue
my essence once felt desperate and left me
and i guess its now i find out about that cuz ive been living under a shallow mask
hiding under this costume of what some believe that i am
of that fake me that never was what i wished to be
what i wanted to become
and what i showed never felt like
i was afraid of showing my true self
scared of societies reaction to
then i faced and overcomed my fears
and everything i once feared happened
i was left alone left out
hypocrites that once stood by me went away
shallow thoughts and experiences were just forgotten
to me and everything i had lived them with
then i just realized i was
and had always been alone
alone in a world where fake
that is just not me
once again with these dark thoughts that torture my fragile little mind
that make me doubt myself
my own mind makes me tremble
i have fallen onto the ground
death is finally getting close
close enough for me to feel faded
giving out my last throes
scribbling some shallow words onto a paper
im sure will be thrown away
cuz when anyone finds me itll be way too late
all that im writing will be covered by blood
the writings will be ruined
too blurry to be read and itll be way too late
and as i said it was too late
shallow people stood by me
things that just faded away
and you wish to go back
youve reached the point of no return
you and you mistakes are here
nothing good lies in between these walls
everything that once tormented you is here
just to make your life miserable
here in the point of no return you live as if life was a simple burden
and for some nothings changed
and it will always be
if you dont stop running
all of those things youve tried you run away from will haunt you if you dont stop running and start facing
life isnt milk and cookies
so it all depends on what you do
to continue running or start being you
i was stuck in a hospital
i think someone stabbed me
cuz there was a lot of blood
i woke up on a bed
i had been unconscious for quite long
according to what the nurse said
still i can remember some parts of the surgery
on the perfect white sheets
blood mixed with some alcohol
all the doctors saying were loosing her
all the nurses giving things to the doctor
pressure level is too low
i cant remember very well
asked her for a piece of paper
she said i couldnt have either of them
i tried to ask why
but the words didnt come out
and light never came into my eyes again
blake has lured you into this dark alleyway
as you wait for your eyes to adjust you feel something brush against your neck
there is a slight popping noise of fangs sinking into your veins
you are paralysed while the blood drains from your body
as the fangs retract you feel a new strength and a new coldness in your limbs
you have joined the ranks of the undead
once again im feeling hole
i wish for this life to just go
can you please show me the way
theres no way out now
im bored of living in a world where no one is true
when you know how to pull it off right
it helps a lot in getting shit
in getting shit into peoples minds
as we both once said
you only see what they want you to see
never will you know who someone really is
you just see what they want you to see
i guess youve shown enough now
im not gonna beg anyone to be my friend
it should be for your own will not mine
i am still right here
i guess youve told me so
is that all you want
oh no wonder youre talking to me again
i shouldve expected for that
for something to go wrong again
trying to make things right again
im fed up with that shit
cuz thats all it is
through me the way into the suffering city through me the way to the eternal pain through me the way that runs among the lost
justice urged on my high artificer my maker was divine authority the highest wisdom and the primal love
before me nothing but eternal things were made and i endure eternally
abandon every hope ye who enter here
the gates to hell dante
by tiri i was sitting in the police station when someone called and reported a dead body in an apartment in malibu street
i was stuck with a lot of work but when i heard the name of the dead person i couldnt resist taking the case
it was a guy that had been my friend in high school i just needed to know what had happened
i went to this house was huge i entered the room and i saw the body lying out there i thought how could it be possible that a person could kill somebody that special
i started investigating and picking up evidence in that moment i saw some papers and the phone miss placed placed on a table that was beside the bed they were all disorganized like if he trying to get the phone had disorganized them
i came up to the table and there was a name that caught my attention jane warrens she was a girl that studied with us in high school there was an address and a phone number
it made me think about why stewart had this information so i decided to investigate more deeply
this was because i knew that he had a crush on her since she knew her and the last time i talked to him he still thought about her
so i made my people check his phone bill his accounts and thinks that could take me to some idea to start looking for a suspect
when i had all the results i noticed that the name jane warrens appeared in most of the phone calls he made
i decided to investigate her more deeply
i went to her house and in the moment she saw me she didnt recognize me but then when i presented my self she knew who i was
we started talking about how life was going for both of us and in between the chatting i told her about stewarts death
she seamed surprised and with the look of her face i started doubting about if she that was so sweet could kill somebody
then i met her husband mathew a tall and strong man
he was really kind to me and i didnt waist my opportunity to ask him what he knew about this murder in this moment a saw his reaction he was really nervous and he didnt know what to answer
i started to suspect of him but i didnt tell them anything
first i investigated mathews life and see what he did for a living and how he spent his days for the last 2 months
in between months there was a week where he got out of work and he didnt leave a message were he could be found i started suspecting
i started comparing information about the two guys lives and about things that had happened through that time
i noticed something strange in those two weeks that mathew had left him office with out leaving a message his wife had been receiving some messages and some roses from another guy
this made my suspects more accurate
mathew had been spying on her husband since the first letter arrived and when he discovered that his wife was cheating on him he decided to kill him
one week went by and now i had all the evidence i needed to take mathew to the police station to make him some questions
i went to their house and i asked jane were he was
he wasnt at home she told me he was working and asked me what was wrong i told her about the evidences i found and she freaked out but i couldnt talk to her i had to get the guy as soon as possible
i went to his office and there he was talking on the phone so calmed and sure of himself but when i entered and he looked at me he freaked out and left the phone drop
i told him he had to accompany me to the police station that i had some questions for him
he said that he was mistaken that he had nothing to do with the murder but still i made him come with me
at the police station i told him what was wrong and why i had called him to ask him some questions
he felt so confused like if he didnt know what i was talking about it made me doubt but i still asked him all sort of questions
after a while of talking and asking question he told me the truth the whole story
we went into my office so he could feel more comfortable we sat down and then he started talking
two months ago i was on a business trip closing a really important deal for the company
i was away for two weeks and a half and when i came back i noticed that my wife was behaving really strange with me
at first i didnt care i thought that she had a lot of stress on her because around that time she was organizing a family party that was really important
a week went by the party was over and i still noticed that behavior
i started to suspect that something was wrong she came late at night saying that she was with her sister or with a friend talking about further parties and events they were planning to do but that became so often that i started to investigate
one night i went to her moms house and i saw that her sister was there when before in that day she had told me that she was spending the day with her sister
it was strange but i thought that she could be with a friend or that by that time she was going home and we didnt cross over in the way
i returned home expecting to see her there but she wasnt
30 minutes later she entered and when she saw me in the couch waiting for her she started to act really nervous
i told her where she was and she told me she was with her sister
from there i knew something was wrong the next night i decided to follow her
she drove over to an apartment i didnt now from who it was from all the friends that she had and that i knew no one lived there
i freaked out but i said to my self not to panic that maybe she had a client for another party
i waited out side until she came out
when she left i decided to go up stairs and see who it was she was with
it was a guy i had never seen before so i started to suspect that she was cheating on me
i didnt ask her anything when i got home neither she asked me where i was
this made me suspect even more about mathew and i told him that if from what he was telling me he didnt think i was going to suspect even more
he told me to listen to him
the next day when i went out for the news paper i saw roses beside it
there was a letter saying to my dearest and beautiful love hope you like them and see you soon love sk i picked up the newspaper and the roses i didnt mentioned anything at breakfast and neither did she
the next three day i followed her and she went always to the same place and every day i asked her where she was and every day she told me she was with somebody arranging things for some parties
the fourth day i followed her until the 5th floor where this guy lived i saw her kiss him as soon as he opened the door from there i suspected what was happening next
i felt betrayed failed i felt so bad i didnt know what to do
i went down i jumped in my car and drove away without course
the next day she was acting as she did before all sweet and beautiful as the day we got married but from what i knew i was the one acting strange
i decided i was focusing more on my work and let her drown herself until she had to tell me the truth even though i was furious and wanted to kill the guy
for the following week and a half i dedicated my body and soul to work because there was a mayor problem with the deal i had make like a month before so i had to go out and make some things to straighten things up and thats why i didnt left messages because we didnt want no body to know what was going on and it was a really huge deal that maybe the company could loose a lot of money
so we wanted to stay shut
i knew about the murder the day after it was committed and when i saw you come in to out home i was pretty nervous because two day before stewart was killed jane went out late at night with the roses that arrived that day it seemed like if she was trying to free her self from it so i didnt notice but well i had already notice a long time ago
the day the murder was committed was the last day the roses arrived
that night i went out with some of my colleagues to celebrate the success in closing up the deal and having solved all the problems we had
i was almost midnight when i went home when i was parking my car janes car stationed beside
i suspected that she had gone to see him i was so furious that i got in my car and told her i had forgotten something at the office that was really important
i got into the car and drove to this guys apartment i was really mad i went to talk to him i knocked on the door but there was no answer
i knocked several times and then decided to through the door down
when i opened the door i found him lying on the floor with blood all over the place i touched his neck to see if he had a pulse but he was gone
so that was when i called the police and reported the murder and thats the whole story i was shocked on what i just have heard
how could i have been so blind not suspecting of her first
she trying to incriminate her husband saying that he came in late without saying where he was and all sorts of actions that he was supposedly doing but the truth was that she was the one doing them
in that precise moment i stepped out of the office and went for and order to arrest this woman
we went to her house and told her to come with us she was resisting and saying she had nothing to do with what had happened
but still forced we made her accompany us
right back at the police station we placed her in a room to ask her some questions
she didnt want to answer and we couldnt obligate her to talk
so i decide to look for another method
i asked mathew to talk to her and he accepted
he entered the room and as soon she saw him she felt so guilty for making him go through what he had gone that she confessed everything
the roses were all fake she sent them herself to make it seem like if it was a guy that was obsessed with her and that she was having an affair
she made this be so obvious to his husband so he noticed that she was having an affair and he went to kill the guy for stilling his wife
in the end she saw that her husband didnt care so she decided to murder him herself but leaving evidence that seemed as if her husband had killed him
she also said that the affair never happened that the made it up just because she was angry with him because he didnt close a huge deal for a party from where she could get a great amount of money she could use to pay a debt that she had
we let mathew out he had his face red and his eyes full of tears
we told him that everything was going to be o
k now that she had confessed
he asked me what was going to happen to her and i told him that because she had accepted the crime and claimed herself guilty maybe the judge could conceder the penalty
he thanked me about everything
i walked him to the door and shake his had
again he said thank you and with his soul in deep pain and tears running down his face i saw him walk away and jump into his car and drive away

have i ever told you
this world is not for you
thnx 4 waiting so long to show yourself
that you cant be harmed
that everything goes over and beneath you
you believe things never touch you
you dont even ask for forgiveness when you ruin it all
you expect me to apologize for things that youve done wrong
expecting more from me than what i can give
and i just wish that i was gone
not even opening up a little for me to come in
to come in and help
but you wont let me in
do you like to wish on things so impossible
and you cant do it alone
simple society wont let you do it
youll be stopped and you will fail
but i can always be wrong
my dearest ive missed you very very much since that last night we were together and will hold that night specially in my memories for years to come
ive been turning it over and over in my mind lately ive read your letter through at least four times and would probably read it more times before im through
ive been sitting here looking at your picture and getting more home sick every minute
ive wanted that picture more than anything else i known of except of course
i keep thinking of you darling keep wishing i could be home with you
i want to leave in the worse possible way so i can come home to see you but
things dont look so good on that subject
this war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone i guess ive never been so lonesome in my life as i am right now
im completely lost without you darling
i never realized i could miss any one person so much
i just cant wait too much longer until im able to be with you again
and live a sane and normal life
they sink and they drown 2 mins before they hit the ground
so i feel this is coming to and end
are gonna be there till then
we say forever not knowing how long it is
we say forever and promises brake before theyre made
we say forever and we go
we leave and forever brakes
we sometimes believe in things that seem perfect
perfection aint perfect and that as a fact can be easily proved
fullfillment joy for this fake concept of total hapiness that gets easily overwhelmed by despair it dies and so do most of our souls
still trying to find out a reason
am i freak in the darkness or am i misfit you speak them opinions to sink in so deep
but its alright youre just an illusion confused by your narrow mind
reality is up ahead in tha distance but that lack of persistance has left you behind
now your reaching for your sanity cause youre afraid of me so dont fuck with me
you wanna ask me a question well i gotta question
how much longer can i tolerate this shit
egos trip when your livin on tha flipside
drop out of a uterus and died damn
i see ya pointin your finger ya stereotype me cause you dont like me well you dont even know me punk
stereotype me cause you dont like me nbsp

33 you are not bound to loss and silence
for you are not bound to the circles of this world
all things must pass away all life is doomed to fade sorrowing you must go and yet you are not without hope
by tiriall rights reserved bill moritz known as the kidnapped boy was a guy that had big expectations in his life he wanted to finish school to go to university and study what he like best ecology
he was a boy that liked exploration and he always said that he will dedicate all his life to go on adventures all around the world doing what he liked most climbing
he had a great childhood but when he was an adolescent he had a bad incident he was kidnapped and kept for almost a year
but even though he had this bad experience in the past he had dreams of going to the highest mountains and reaching the top
actually one of his adventures happened two weeks ago when he decided to make a journey to el cocui snow mountain
he was so excited he couldnt wait one more day he packed and got organized and left everything ready for his trip
finally the perfect and expected wild day arrived
he got on his car turned the radio on and left the station where they were giving the new because he wanted to know how the climate was on the area
few minutes latter he stopped surprised of what he had heard over the news
he was really worried and scared the cocui was filled up with guerrilla and the kidnap statistics was of a 90 probability
but even though he was scared and not really sure if he should continue he filled with courage and carried on with his dream
the next day he arrived to one of the most dangerous mountain of el cocui named la laguna de los verdes
bill started to feel and smell the soft and comfortable aroma of the wind and he saw the beautiful colors of nature he felt so secure and happy he knew that he was where he belonged free and in peace
after a moment he heard a really strange noise that made him come back to reality and remember his past and what he had heard the day before
he was frightened he felt as if he were living a flashback
he heard some gunshots he was frightened he didnt know what to do he was paralyzed he just wished he had returned when he had the chance
he started to run in no direction and after a while of running he ended up in a dark and endless cave
he didnt notice that in the cave there was some ice blocks falling from the top and that in the floor there were some human footsteps so he continued walking knowing that there he would be secure
after a while of walking he heard some screaming they came from far away it seemed to be from a girl a kidnapped girl who was screaming for help
he continued walking and when he least expected he was eye covered and he felt that someone grabbed his arm and painfully twisted it to his back he felt as it thy were taking his arm away
he heard a mans voice ordering him to walk but because he was so scared it seemed difficult to do it
after a while of not knowing to where he was taken he heard the girls voice again
every time the girl voice got closer and closer
then instantaneously the bandage was off and he had the chance to look down and when he did he saw a small girl
the man made him sit down beside her and ordered him to stay quiet
even though the man told him not to he talked for a while with the girl letting the time pass and the night to arrive
when it did arrived he didnt remember falling a sleep
at some point in the middle of the night he woke up all sweaty
he was home in his bed and the day of his journey hadnt arrived
he realized that he was living a lie everything was ok when he figured out what had happened he calmed down nothing was happening
he would be living tomorrow and his trip was going to be the first of so many trips to come
never to return again but always in my heart
in my eyes indisposed in disguise as no one knows hides the face lies the snake the sun in my disgrace boiling heat summer stench neath the black the sky looks dead call my name through the cream and ill hear you scream again soundgarden

esto puede ser un poco disturbing para alguna gente
ultimamente estoy escribiendo muy crudo y pues decidi meter esto aca
continue at your own risk jeje
se sent en su cama una vez mas esperando a su cliente esperando al nuevito del dia
nada cambi a la habitacin entr un hombre desagradable gordo y con poca clase
sabia que iba a ser una de las peores noches de su vida sabia que podia impedirlo pero
el tipo pagaba bien y ella necesitaba ese dinerito extra despues de todo la vida no es tan sencilla
y cuando toca pues toca
la noche transcurrio como cualquier otra
hizo su trabajo y el hombre se fue a eso de las 2am
sali de la habitacion y se dispuso a ir a casa
se encontro con su jefe ste le pago y le ofreci un taxi
sta acepto se puso una gabardina negra que le haban regalado de navidad y sali
se mont en su taxi
le olia algo raro pero lo ignor
despues de todo a las 2am cualquier taxi tiene su vaina
depronto despert no sabia donde estaba
se encontr encadenada y encerrada en un cuarto oscuro
asustada intento soltarse no pudo
tanto era el miedo que la invadia q no fue capaz nisiquiera de gritar
pasaron unos 20 minutos y entr un hombre usando pasamontaas tenia una voz algo aspera poco confiable
ella pregunto donde estaba y entr en llanto
el hombre simplmente la miro
la viol y sali de la habitacion
luego oy unos gritos algo como usted sabia que no podia tocarla
unos golpes y luego un tiro de pistola
no entendia nada entr una vez mas en un llanto profundo entr un nuevo hombre
le bot un plato de comida y le dijo que se callara si no queria q l la callara
ella se callo por miedo a otra violacin o algo peor
comio esa desagradable sopita de frijoles q le habian botado ahi
se preparo para ser una vez mas herida
ste nuevo hombre se quito el pasamontaas era el taxista
ella empez a llorar de nuevo
le dijo q estuviera tranquila
le explic q por ser la preferida de su jefe estaba ahi
q dependa de l si sala de ah o no
luego recodo una tarde llegando al bar
unos hombres estaban golpeando a don tito su jefe
y este famoso taxista estaba entre ellos
todo tuvo sentido por un momento
la hicieron leer un papel q decia tenemos a samantha su favorita perro
le toco pagarnos o la matamos
tenga una respuesta o atengase
crey q la iban a matar temia tambien de la vida de don tito haba sido como un padre para ella y no queria perderlo
decidio intentarlo le daban 20 minutos al dia para ir al bao lavarse los dientes y demas
la ventana tenia unas barras
pero estaban algo flojas ya
y as empez su plan
iba a aflojarlas cada vez mas
a pedir un poco mas de tiempo en el bao dia tras dia
su plan funciono a la perfeccin
entro al bao como siempre
se paro en la tasa y quito todas las barras
lo hizo lo mas silenciosa que pudo
de repente la puerta se abri
la puteo y se la llevo
la encerr una vez mas
las cadenas estaban ahora atadas a un poste en la mitad d esta nueva habitacin
con un pequeo colchon de un lado y le puso una telita inmunda y maloliente en los ojos
era golpeada todas las noches por esto
un dia entro el taxista su jefesito no quizo pagar
y nosostros no podemos tenerla mas aca
nos dieron buen billete por usted
entonces hoy se va a su nuevo trabajito
la cogieron y metieron en el taxi de nuevo
le pusieron una cobija encima
si en algun momento habia tenido algo totalmente claro fue ahi
o se escapaba o se escapaba
se quito la tela de los ojos
el taxi paro en un semaforo
el tipo que la iba cogiedo se levanto un momento para comprar unos cigarrillos
quito muy sigilosamente el seguro
corrio como nunca habia corrido en su vida
los dos tipos se bajaron del carro
ya habia logrado lo mas dificl
corrio hasta no poder mas
se escondio en una ferreteria
el dueo le pregunto q le pasaba
de buenas le toco un buen hombre
le llamo un taxi y le dio 5mil pesos para pagarlo
ni a bate se metia en un taxi ya
entonces cogio bus nada mas seguro q un bus
llego a su casa a su familia
volvio al trabajo al siguiente dia
sentada en su cama espero a su cliente
i just needed someone to talk to you were just too busy with yourself
ill never be the same again
los verdaderos amigos vienen solitos so i might aswell guess who those true ones are
those who kept close now
im not afraid of ending up alone
i guess i just am right now
loneliness does not scare me
it flirts around untill it just stays here in me
or forever after ever had a chance to grow
what you lose is what you know what i am is yet to show
just dont lose what you know
when im so far away
but dont look back in anger
just so that you know
im into anger management right now
shhh how much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it
life went wrong just breathe
theres nothing left to lose nothing left to hide
here i am only with my naked soul to show
what i see is whats to be
and it is worthy to say
that ive never felt this way the emptiness inside scares me
but ill fill it someday
hope to fill it trully and completely
not as it once was
but i had to find out today
and some may say youve got just what you wanted but who could ever want this lies
here in my mind you know you might find
you thought you once knew but now its all gone and you know its no fun you know its no fun
now im lost im stranded and fading
but theres no use now
im depending on a fucing decision that i cant seem to trust completely
i brought this on myself
damn can i be stupid

who do you take me for willy wonka
voy a volar como un guila o en su defecto caer como una vaca
follow the c o l o r s
can you see the colors of the rain
do you dream or do you sleep
could this actually be real
do you hear or do you listen
do you actually wish upon a shooting star
it is the passion flowing right on through your veins and its the feeling that youre oh so glad you came it is the moment you remember youre alive it is the air you breathe the element the fire it is that flower that you took the time to smell it is the power that you know you got as well it is the fear inside that you can overcome this is the orchestra the rhythm and the drum it is the soundtrack of your everflowing life it is the wind beneath your feet that makes you fly it is the beautiful game that you choose to play when you step out into the world to start your day you show your face and take it in and scream and pray youre gonna win it for yourself and us today it is the gold the green the yellow and the grey the red and sweat and tears the love you go

when you have the will you learn to forgive and to forget you have to collect the broken pieces and humble hearted stand up from the place you hide if i wouldnt know to miss anything it couldnt hurt me no more mistakes tought to build life from the ashes that fell down to ground without any pain it wouldnt be the same experiences made me strong not every pain hurts deep inside when you learn to devide dont fear the danger follow your heart to the light live your dream and breath

escribo mi propia historia y slo vivo al paso soy el nico que se percata de m y todas las voces que escucho son slo ecos de mi deseo impotente enfrento a mi soledad e impotente le doy la cara desintegrado en miles de pedazos me arrastro en miles de direcciones y no sostengo tu mano lo suficientemente firme escapo en falsos sueos me he sentado en lugares ocupados he buscado la gloria de estar contigo y slo encontr la ridcula soledad
nosotras en un dia normal del 2004

kevin got an email from the sportswear place asking his salary range
although unscrupulous i intercepted this email via webmail and replied with a 25k30k requirement citing that the last job held paid 28k with benefits
after sending this email i let it remain in the inbox to be downloaded to his outlook
as predicted he saw the email and wanted to respond to it with a 2530k requirement
so while he was indisposed in the shitter i made a dummy email that said the same thing and sent it to a dummy email addy
it was bounced back undeliverable but i deleted it from the inbox and deleted mail box so hell never know the difference
when he came back in from the bathroom he read the sent copy and was satisfied with the reply
not that he should actually send his own stuff
i wrote the cover letter
i applied him for it
then he has the audacity to tell me he has to do everything because i ask him to bring me something from the kitchen while he is up and already in the kitchen
he better get this friggin job because ill be god damned if i have to sell my car so we can get by and i have to drive a junk piece of shit even though i make a ton of money
sad but true i have to pay for every bill plus my debt rent car payment vacation fund which i made a separate one for me pet costs food everything
he even asked if i could use my credit card to buy him toys
what i dont think so asshole
if i have to do without some things i like so do you
im contemplating giving up my car that i worked hard for but you want to go on buying fucking toys not going to happen
i wish i could sleep all day and basically be unemployed and have no qualms about it
just to be a slug and all
i have to make huge sacrifices and slug just sleeps all day

in september of 1996 i was backpacking through israel when i landed in the northern hill town of tzfat aka safed
tzfat is the epicenter of jewish mysticism and has become a
mecca for people interested in living a thoroughly jewish life complete with exhaustive ritual and worship but with a focus on the more esoteric teachings of kabbalah rather than the more literal judaism prevelent in jerusalem
often people arrive in tzfat wanting to merely dabble but end up moving there and dramatically changing their lives
for lodging i stayed at a hostel run by an orthodox jewish organization providing free shelter in exchange for attendance at religious education classes held several times a day
its no secret that many jewish tourists traveling around israel have a sometimes hidden sometimes not agenda to have some kind of religious or spiritual experience while in the holy land especially jews from the u
where spirituality is mostly marginalized
after all when you return from a trip to israel you will invariably be asked by many people whether or not anything happened and by the way the question is formed you know theyre not asking whether or not you got sick from eating too many dates
in tzfat something happened but ive only recently figured out what it was
i had already been through jerusalem and had prayed at the holiest jewish site in the world the western wall the remnants of the holy temple destroyed by the romans in 68 c
while it was indeed an incredible place to visit and while i did feel the weight of history and the echoes of millions of prayers thick in the air i came away feeling like something was missing as if i was supposed to have had a catharsis or awakening
indeed nothing so dramatic happened during my entire visit
and so i came to tzfat a bit let down but not without hope that id pick up something of spiritual value
it was in that spirit that i attended a morning class with a rabbi whose name sadly never stuck with me
we spent the entire hour talking about the first line of the book of genesis
well at least the rabbi tried to contain the discussion to the first line quoting commentary written over hundreds of years analyzing every word in that first sentence
every word of course had numerous possible meanings as there is a great deal of interpretation that comes with translating from hebrew
so i thought this level of scrutiny was a green light for me to ask a question about the rest of the creation story a question that had bugged me for years
hjm rabbi do you really believe that heaven and earth were created in 6 days six days as we know them now six twentyfour hour days rabbi yes i do
hjm what about modern interpretations that suggest the possibility that each of those 6 days actually lasted millions of years rabbi no
they were twentyfour hour days just as we experience them today
hjm so you actually believe that is has only been 5755 years since heaven and earth were created
hjm what about science what about carbon date testing that shows fossils to be millions of years old rabbi scientists believe what they want to believe and i believe what i want to believe
on the surface there was nothing remarkable about this rabbi
he wore the traditional black and white clothes his hair and beard were characteristically unkempt he was probably not that much older than me but hed forgotten more about judaism than i had ever learned
in hindsight what i realize now as significant was the utter sincerity the quiet conviction the peacefulness he exuded comforted by his faith and under no pressure whatsoever to justify it to anyone
sure he taught the classes in hopes that others might share the rewards of his faith
yet he had no desire to force his views on anyone
so it strikes me how different he was from other people i have met who profess a deep passionate faith
it has been my misfortune to have more than once been confronted by religious zealotry an entirely different practice in faith with a very different presentation
the zealot seems driven more by desperation than anything else
they have seen the light and operate from a place of panic feeling that they are personally responsible for the salvation of others
for years after my trip i liked to tell the story about that rabbi and it is with some degree of shame that i realize that i actually took delight in pointing out what until now seemed like the worst kind of blind faith the shunning of fundamental scientific discoveries in favor of a literal interpretation of a document the bible that scientists and scholars have made few solid conclusions about
i got a lot of mileage with that anecdote and missed the point completely
in the end it was more important that the rabbi was benevolent than whether or not he was right about the origins of the universe
one can have all the faith in the world but if heshe does not practice tolerance towards fellow humans who have their own version of faith if they are motivated by desperation rather than love then not only are they are in no position to be prosletyzing but they are hardly models of an enlightened being totally incapable of demonstrating the benefits of faith

josh marshall made a post to his blog last night that is very tempting to believe
he talks about the tone of the democratic national convention as being starkly different from the tone of the campaign amongst the candidates for the nomination
much has been said in the media about how the rhetoric of the dnc has been surprisingly light in terms of attacks on the bush administration and josh offers his explanation in two points first on the surface the fiery rhetoric and animus of 2003 and early 2004 were directed at president bush
and to some degree of course they were
but the punch of that rhetoric derived not so much from democrats antipathy for president bush as from a pitched battle almost a rebellion within the democratic party the grassroots of the democratic party insisting that washington democrats were compromising with the president over particulars when he was leading the country in a direction that had to be opposed across the board
fiery rhetoric against president bush was fiery rhetoric against compromise and accommodation with him
in other words it was to a very real degree aimed at other democrats
second anger is often and rage is almost always an emotion rooted in powerlessness
that was certainly the position of democrats in early 2003 on so many levels though less so as the year went on
these democrats dont feel powerless
the mood is one of cautious optimism that they can drive the president from office that the wind is at their backs
so josh thinks the change in tone is a sign of unity and optimism
that certainly is a glasshalffull way to interpret it
yet while id rather be optimistic the polls showing bush and kerry in a dead heat despite the glaring fact that the bush administration has dragged this country through the gutter erode my ability to believe that the democratic party has what it takes to beat the republicans
what josh sees as a new found confidence i see as fearful tiptoe dancing around the swing voters
the point that anger is almost always rooted in powerlessness while likely true rules out the potent combination of anger and confidence righteous indignation that occasionally surfaces during struggles for freedom and justice
as a model i look to dr
mlk spoke the plain truth and there was no way to hide the legitimate anger he felt about racism
he had utter confidence that he was right and deep faith that he would succeed
i find it deeply ironic that the most successful movies in america are blockbuster action films with heroes who act out of righteous indignation
it is a classic american icon yet somewhere along the line the democratic party decided that this formula doesnt work
yes the media jumped all over howard dean for his postiowa pep rally
the key however was how the dean campaign and the democrats in general reacted
rather than defend the emotion that dean was showing which i contend was much more that of enthusiasm than anger they apologized and toned it down
this is classic pacification and the worst part is that it is selfinflicted
the new york times week in review what boston can do for kerry yet for all that the american convention remains a singular moment in the nominating process a relic of a bygone time perhaps but a relic that nonetheless keeps driving the story line of a presidential election
and that is no small matter for john kerry the likely democratic nominee
kerry will head to boston where the convention begins next monday remembering and trying to duplicate mr
americans do not seem overly enthused about him
if polls showing him tied with mr
bush are to be believed mr
kerry has so far been unable to take advantage of abundant evidence that americans are looking for a change in the white house
kerrys advisers say that it is not that voters dont like him it is that they still do not know him even after 80 million worth of television advertisements close to 50 candidate debates and almost two years of campaigning
kerrys aides see these polls and are clearly hungering for these four days in boston to break this deadlock preparing with a level of intensity and detail that serves as the ultimate validation of the power of conventions
this year the democratic national convention is taking place merely for big dems to glad hand one another and for some little dem wannabes to wait for the party to collapse
what is emphasized above i stated was kerrys electability problem back in februarymarch not here but elsewhere as tfloss hadnt been around then
back then i was even leaning to voting for bush if the democratic national party allowed the early primaries to elect a candidate who may have been winning the party faithful but had no chance of winning over the democratic population at large
sooner or later with kerry it may very well be later the dems need to wake up and realize they are flailing about in an identity crisis
that they have allowed themselves to become republicans in dress and democrats in name only is shameful
the democratic party needs an overhaul
gore losing to bush was plenty evidence
how many more senators must they run out there to be slaughtered as many others opine americans do recognize that bush has his failings but many of those same americans look at kerry and wonder
and think ummm thats a haggard al gore with a big coif
the insincerity meter runs high around kerry in comparison to bush
and that meter often sways elections no really it does
bush may be a wordfumbling dolt on stage but hes a sincere wordfumbling dolt on and off stage
voters who have doubts will go for the sincere incumbent every time no matter how much he bungled things
kerry unlike rabblerouser howard dean and his yyyyyyyyahping which in the long run would have been a positive kerry has said and done nothing to convince those looking for a change to look his way
it has been 52 years since a convention really chose the candidate when democrats in chicago nominated adlai stevenson
over the next 40 years conventions became the stage for presenting a running mate as a way of keeping some interest in the event
even that little gift of news has slipped away over the years mr
edwards three weeks before the convention
granted the conventions are more about rallying and grooming but never before were the early primary returns allowed to run roughshod over the entire primary process
the west coast complains about early returns on the east coast affecting elections well what about primaries thankfully edwards was named to the ticket
if it wasnt for him id be voting same as i did in 1976 mickey and minnie mouse
dont expect the dnc to change that matter
that is unless the big dems wisely allow john edward to run the show from here on out
he is capable of reaching those seeking change
he is positive and upbeat
kerry is a reminder of the past
a reminder of the shell the democratic party has become
but the candidate must be earnest
he must not be afraid to make mistakes
kerry copies gws advertising and doesnt differentiate himself in the least
he wouldnt want to do something the focus groups dont approve
hes a deer in the headlights
rather a deer in the bed of the grand ol partys hemi
this is jek and i approved this blog
well i done didnt do nuttin
the fort was robbed and the muffins are gone
its all about hojo the man with the vision

this will likely be my last post until monday july 19th as i will be on a road trip with my family around the selkirk mountains and i dont have a laptop
oh the shame in the meantime i leave you with these few items 1
update on michael moores blog
the pattern appears to continue as hes only made two posts since his july 4th launch
scientist believe saturns rings formed a few hundred million years ago when debris from colliding comets and moons was drawn into orbit around the planet by its gravitational influence
i read this to a coworker and she said its pretty funny to her how scientists think they can really determine that a few hundred million years ago given the vastness of space that comets which on earth we only get to see every 50 years or so actually collided with moons and the debris resulted in the rings
science or science fiction 3
sticks and stones will break my bones
i took real pleasure in reading about the sound asswhoopin the bush administration received at a recent benefit concert that raised 7
5 million with a concert for democratic candidates john kerry and john edwards an angry bush campaign challenged their opponents on friday to release a videotape showing performers calling the president a liar and a cheap thug during the show
actor chevy chase drew laughs and cheers from the radio city music hall audience when he described politicians and their hobbies clinton plays the sax john plays the guitar and the presidents a liar
john mellencamp sang let me tell you a story about the texas bandito a tune that referred to bush as a cheap thug
if john kerry is going to praise last nights starstudded hate fest and characterize it as the heart and soul of america he should share these values with voters everywhere bushcheney campaign manager ken mehlman said friday in a statement
we call on kerry to release the video of this event so that all americans can see what john kerry has called americas heart and soul
josh marshalls got a post up today about news from afghanistan concerning a mercenary of sorts who
was arrested with others for conducting a selfappointed counterterrorism mission that included abusing eight inmates in a private jail by hanging them by their feet
josh goes on to question what someone is doing operating a private jail especially since it is very unclear who if anyone hired him
his last paragraph reads it just seems like someone must have been paying this guy to do something unless its like a blog where you just set up shop and figure that someday a revenue stream might turn up
sure i see the intended humor but i find myself very uncomfortable with the comparison
all in all a disturbing story if you choose to follow the link to the abcnews
com page it appears on
makes me think of all those movie moments when a cia agent or special forces soldier is given an assignment and when he is told that the mission is top secret he responds what mission sir
wilco has another great album out a ghost is born theres a lead story on wilco and jeff tweedy in rolling stone and still so few people it seems appreciate what wilco has accomplished
from their inception and through the masterpiece summerteeth wilco were master chefs taking ingredients from their myriad influences and whipping them up into the yummiest of delicacies
homage is a word that often comes to mind when listening to wilco since the musical references are so overt that it is impossible to label them as ripoffs
yet what is most remarkable about the band is what they have done in their last two albums yankee hotel foxtrot and now a ghost is born
what weve seen or perhaps more appropriately heard has been the metamorphosis from a band of masterful interpreters of classic poprockcountry music to the creators of their very own unique sound
yes the influences are still there but they are now relegated to background filler or the occasional brief keyboard or guitar lick
it will be very exciting to watch where they will go from here
i dont know whether to be amused or disturbed by this article in tuesdays 7604 washington post
on the surface it seems like a simple look at how silly things get in the world of domain names
six years ago an indianapolis bail bondsman kerry edwards created his own web domain www
according to the article the day it was announced that sen
john edwards would be kerrys running mate indianapolis edwards was called by the kerry campaign to discuss purchase of the domain name
apparently the asking price was too high
so it seems like a fairly harmless humorous human interest story
right reading on we learn about other cybersquatters who have purchased domain names hoping to cash in other obvious choices for a campaign web site kerryedwards04
net have already been registered according to publicly available internet records
yet the disturbing part comes in this disclosure by one of these hopeful opportunists kevin draftz of chicago draftz said his first choice of buyers is the kerry campaign but would not rule out selling them to the competition
and we or at least i wonder what is wrong with democracy in america
ive mentioned stellastarr before well not here and maybe not on the web wait

michael moore celebrated independence day by launching a blog
its amazing that it took him so long since blogging seems like a natural fit for him
july 4th 2004 1015 pm my first blog entry hey my first blog entry welcome fellow bloggers and blog readers blog doggers and blog loggers
blogging away for the common good or just to keep from watching whatever crap is on tv right now
what is on tv right now no new 6 feet under tonight
the practice has been bounced
cant jon stewart do a sunday show it will be interesting to see if he can keep it up
hes tried an online diary before and subscribers to his email list can confirm that he regularly promises to write more often but does not
the nerve its almost as if he thinks that writing best selling books and academy and cannes award winning movies is more important than communicating with his fans
seventy percent of media consumers use multiple forms of media at the same time according to a study for the media center at api key study findings include people who regularly or occasionally watch tv and read the newspaper at the same time 74
2 people who regularly or occasionally watch tv while going online 66
for simultaneous online users tv viewing is down 8
8 among 18 to 24 yearolds and down 12
2 among 25 to 34 yearolds in favor of video games what people do as they wait for downloads from the internet listen to the radio 52
8 read the newspaper 20
2 importance of word of mouth when it comes to making purchase decisions 72
5 of all consumers say its very important versus 80 among cell phone users
one way to read this news is to understand that the quality of each medium does not warrant focused attention
or americans adhd all of em
btw this is old news from march 24
hey if you use microsoft internet explorer dont be a dope update it
and install spybot search destroy spysweeper and hijackthis
then run each of them
if you want to try out other browsers which i suggest then i suggest firefox or opera
both have their plusses and minuses but both work well once you get used to them
currently i am trying to get used to firefox and how it aint so google friendly takes an extra click to access some of my favorite features like blog this news images search this site etc
well thats what i call the features
google prolly has other longer names
opera is fast but too many sites are slightly incompatible with it
and for quasineatniks it can drive them batty
if you dont have antivirus protection get some
and if you get a buttload of spam it is your own damn fault
with where you poke your head
porn and shopping and sites will be the death of your pc andor your time
if you are looking for a new media player then i suggest media center
itunes nearing 100m songs sold btw is for kids
it has too few features to be worth using
realplayer is for databases that need rebuilding and people who restart their pc several times a day
if you are that stupid here
windows media player is antimp3
winamp is for skin dweebs
musicmatch is a better realplayer
file this under its 127 am and ive not posted squat here
plus i see howard has simplified the look and wanted to let him know good job p
molly got wordpress which is where my poisonal blog is going once i crawl out from under css and xhtml and design guru wars
note to self if id manage my time better id
no if i focused more my time would not cover more yet not as much
if that makes sense
this blog appears different when viewed by msie like the blogger screenshot or firefox no graphics squared corners poor type handling
will be testing opera soon
spare the rod save the child missouris youth prisons focus on small groups therapy caring
officials in californias punishmentoriented system are taking a look

there are no handcuffs no razorwire fences no uniforms no cells
missouri does things differently in its prisons for young people and it shows in what you see and what you dont
inmates referred to as kids live in dorms that feature beanbag chairs potted plants stuffed animals and bunk beds with smileyface comforters

the old corrections model was a failure most kids left us worse off than when they came in said mark steward the chief of missouris youth penal system
so we threw away that culture and now we focus on treatment on making connections with these guys and showing them another way

very interesting stuff brewing in the africanamerican community
just when you thought it was the politically correct thing to do as a white male to blame racism for the ongoing struggles of blacks in america bill cosby upsets the apple cart and says theres no excuse
during thursdays speech cosby said his detractors were not facing the facts about poor black communities and were just trying to cover up what he called their dirty laundry
let me tell you something your dirty laundry gets out of school at 230 every day its cursing and calling each other nr as theyre walking up and down the street he said
cosby continued railing about the state of black youth in america
they think theyre hip he said
they cant read they cant write
theyre laughing and giggling and theyre going nowhere
to africanamerican men cosby ranted stop beating up your women because you cant find a job
he complained about rap music when you put on a record and that record is yelling nr this and nr that and cursing all over the thing and you got your little sixyearold and sevenyearold sitting in the back seat of the carthose children hear that
and i am telling you when you put the cd on and then you get up and dance to it what are you saying to your children and he also ripped into sitcoms targeting africanamerican audiences comedians coming on tv saying i am so ugly you are ugly yuck yuck
thats all minstrel show stuff
i am tired of it
i cant even talk the way these people talk why you aint where you is
and i blamed the kid until i heard the mother talk cosby said in may
and then i heard the father talk
everybody knows its important to speak english except these knuckleheads
you cant be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth
on thursday cosby further elaborated his thoughts on the subject saying once again that white people arent to blame for teen pregnancy and highschool dropout rates
for me there is a time
when we have to turn the mirror around he said
because for me it is almost analgesic to talk about what the white man is doing against us
and it keeps a person frozen in their seat it keeps you frozen in your hole youre sitting in
easier said than done coming from a very wealthy man i dont know
does he minimize the very real impact of ongoing racism and socioeconomic inequality clearly held in place by a dominant white power structure could be
does what he say have value no doubt
it is not uncle tom to take a hard look at how racism and inequality become internalized by the oppressed to examine how this internalization often manifests as irrational sometimes selfdestructive behavior and cultural trends
it took guts for cosby to take this stance and im glad jesse jackson is supporting him
its crap like this that gives hippies a bad name rock musician david crosby founding member of the byrds and crosby stills nash and young pleaded guilty friday to a gun charge was fined 5000 and sentenced to a conditional discharge
the singer was arrested march 6 at the doubletree suites hotel in midtown manhattan
police said they found a colt
45caliber handgun three clips of
45caliber ammunition and two knives in his luggage
police also said the musician had a plastic bag containing an ounce of marijuana a wooden container with a marijuana cigarette in it a package of cigarette rolling papers and two other plastic containers with marijuana residue
all the lovely music hes made and the mass movement of love and peace that he was a part of is overshadowed by the ridiculous behavior of an old drug addict
more talking points for chronically uptight fascists in training
there are no perfect humans that i know of
for every david crosby theres a jack ryan
by far the best headline ive seen in days late cooking diva julia child loved red meat gin sounds straight out of a grateful dead song
i bet julia also played a mean game of poker
i have a new favorite website
the british newspaper the guardian calls their site guardian unlimited which contains content beyond what they print on paper
noteable for their news coverage from outside the american corporate media machine but just as appealing for their british take on all things cultural its a great place to browse for information and entertainment
the inspiration for this post came from reading two articles online today
barred painters open air nude show naked women cars and sports help doubles sales of mens mags the irony when these two pieces are juxtaposed is so thick and delicious you can cut it with a knife and relish in licking the bowl
yet what came to me when i read the second article is a much more serious issue men being manipulated mostly by other men
it never ceases to amaze me how transparent it all is
dare watching commercial television for even a short while and you will be flooded with promises aimed at men that they will have more sex and more fun if they buy certain products or participate in certain activities
guys wake up dont you see whats going on here you are not that stupid
you are not pavlovian dogs shouldnt you feel insulted used stereotyped doesnt it bother you that its mostly men who are selling these products trying to exploit for their own personal gain you their fellow men and the fact that you have been conditioned to reflexively respond to images of scantily clad women flashy cars rich sports celebrities etc
do you think they should be raking in the dough living a life of luxury while you shell out your hard earned cash on items you might not purchase if you thoroughly thought about the options available
as an example and proof that i am in no way preaching a puritan lifestyle lets look at beer
question why in the world would anyone mindlessly choose budweiser miller or coors when they can be enjoying boundary bay pike or fish tail answer boundary bay pike and fish tail will not use sexual or other manipulative imagery to sell their products
and they actually taste good too
while some would argue that another main reason for choosing bud miller and coors is that they are cheaper i would respond that men could easily afford the more expensive brews if they werent blowing so much money on all the other stuff theyve been manipulated into buying
so my fellow male homo sapiens rise above your caveman roots and join me in a toast over a pint of boundary bays imperial oatmeal stout to the liberation of all men from the sirensindrag of modern advertising gulp
seriously has it come to this last night on a whim i looked up the nj and ny phone numbers for the aclu and put them in my phone

on wednesday today right now i am without coffee beans
gives me a good excuse to walk the mile to the store before seattle does yet another rendition of miami with its toohotforthenatives weather
although yes i am not a native of seattle i do come from a colder place so i can play the trump card here okay so get off my back
i havent had my coffee yet sao paulo brazil ap brazil has announced the creation of a coffee dna data bank which will help the country improve the quality and size of its coffee crop
the announcement was made tuesday by agriculture minister roberto rodrigues during a ceremony at embrapa countrys agricultural research agency
over the past two years and at a cost of 6 million reals 2 million embrapa and the sao paulo state research foundation worked on the coffee genome project which mapped 200000 coffee dna sequences the agriculture ministry said in a statement posted on its web site
cnn well thank gawd for that
amongst the thirty beans or so that i use for my french press there is always one or two beans that simply do not get with the program

but i need some rgxxxkckxsggrrrz coffee of the mr
jekyll variety i dont care right freaking now
a special thanks to buzzflash for helping me start my day with a good laugh
bush campaign holds rally in va
dems sense weakness bush criticized kerrys plan to eliminate the tax cuts for those making more than 200000 a year saying that the rich in america happen to be the small business owners who put people to work
bush also said high taxes on the rich are a failed strategy because the really rich people figure out how to dodge taxes anyway
lombards race is run by brendan mooney cathal lombard has admitted to taking the performance enhancing drug erythropoietin epo
the 28yearold corkman will not contest the findings
i didnt set out to try and win medals or to make money
i just wanted to be as competitive as i could and have an equal chance with everyone else
i am not trying to justify what i did in any way i am just saying this was the case this is what i did and hands up i did it
lombard whose honesty is a historic first expressed his sorrow and apologised to everyone in advance of the pending statement from the athletics association of ireland
i got a letter faxed to me on friday from the irish sports council informing me of a possible breach of the irish antidoping rules he said
irish examiner registration required so see new zealand herald ever since the line went beyond blurry to fullon open use of professionals the olympics has been on a downward spiral
now i do not care much if athletes use drugs or not but if the rules forbid usage then admit it
of course if judgment of rules abuse by the ioc is handled like the ncaa handles its issues then many athletes are unfairly punished when taking something as simple as aspirin or cough medicine
still i gotta admire this irish lad for his admission of guilt
granted he only deserves admiration because many many athletes have long been denying their use of illegal substances
cathal my next guinness or harp will be toasted your way
when the rain comes they run and hide their heads
they might as well be dead when the rain comes when the rain comes
when the sun shines they slip into the shade and sip their lemonade when the sun shines when the sun shines
rain i dont mind shine the weathers fine
i can show you that when it starts to rain everythings the same i can show you i can show you
rain i dont mind shine the weathers fine
can you hear me that when it rains and shines its just a state of mind can you hear me can you hear me
the key to moving towards energy independence is to anticipate the kneejerk reaction that the very powerful energy industry will have to any proposals that suggest a change to the status quo
listen closely you can almost hear them saying it now this policy will put thousands and thousands of americans out of work no actually your pathetic shortsighted management of your companies not planning for the inevitable need to develop new energy resources to position your companies for success in the future will put thousands and thousands out of work
ever have that argument with a free market capitalist who says that there is nothing wrong with big box chain stores like the home depot coming to town and putting mom pop hardware stores out of business whats their biggest argument if mom pop cant get creative and figure out how to compete then its survival of the fittest
any chance that this same free market capitalist would apply that same theory to lets say oil companies who claim that they will be put out of business by competing energy companies i didnt think so
the truth is regardless of how much environmentalists and anticorporation activists despise the current energy industry it makes no sense to propose policies that threaten these corporate giants
if there is one thing that these companies are good at its producing and distributing products to millions of consumers spread all over the globe
yes production and distribution has been extremely destructive to the environment but that is more a function of the toxic nature of the product than their business practices
kerrys plan based on the scanty information available thus far seems to understand the value of making the development of sustainable energy an attractive moneymaking proposition for the energy industry
why reinvent the wheel when we can just make it a better wheel will the energy companies still cry foul yes particularly because they are so financially and politically entangled in the middle east
however given how badly it is going over there while a u
president from an oil family presided over recordbreaking gas prices they may not have a leg to stand on
so ive finally come up for air
im taking too many breaths
ive got so much to do
see in the last month off and on when not becoming a born again digital virgin thats right the technological kid has come in from the analog storm storms are good every now and again ive been swimming through content management systems blogware again and sticking with wordpress and web standards
before posting a lot about which you may have no interest in reading then please skim know that this is all gonna see the light of day sorta at tfloss when its appearance starts to shift
brand identity baby if anybody knows the title of the book tom peters coauthored about branding published circa 1980 please let me know
it was a fantastic book that doesnt contain all the awful selfhelp language he employs these days
the dark side of success
everyone copies you and the parody makes the original laughable
there is a lot to web standards and accessibility
no more do web developers have to write six different pages for six different browsers
mainly they need to focus on 5 of the webs users who use standardscompliant browsers and then do some minimal hacking to accommodate the other 95
please make ie7 the best browser
pray anyway thank gawd that the browser wars are mostly over
now could we do something about our twoparty political process im all about the lack of standards when the two opposing parties are basically the same
um where was i thats right back in the halcyon days of early 2001 when i took to the road i tried to redesign my website from my car while doing 85 mph
zogging while others thought zagging was cooler than zigging
well i quickly learned that my poor html 3 skills were not going to cut it out on the open road
that adobe golive could only do so much and too much bloated code
too many of my friends were having difficulty browsing my site or even downloading it not to mention uploading it from a 14k wireless modem
well the downloadinguploading problem was easily solved but the browser issues were another matter
i threw my hands in the air and awaited the web world people to get their act together
the saddest bit about all of this is that the tools to obtain web standards css loosely design and xhtml loosely structure were finally accepted in prime time when i eschewed my web presence back in latespring of 2001
ive lost three years had i been patient or not been so taken by um well her name is unimportant
content can be achieved by a variety of means as can xhtml but it is all circular and above the reach of this post
so if you are interested in standards i suggest stopping by the sites a list apart and asterisk the latter seems to be the most focused blog on web design issues regarding standards
of course i am only now crawling out from the waters of theory read i was reading books and onto the land of practice read plowing through websites for quick tips as i quickly relaunch my personal website so there is probably a lot more out there concerned with my standards interests both arguments for and against that ive not had enough time to read
oh but heres one funny funny piece gurus v
bloggers 2 part one for those interested in the contradictions of practice what you preach
both these design by fire dxf articles have plenty of great websites listed
you know how it is
last call has come and gone
yes thereve been many identical nights like this one out with friends sharing libations and that simple pleasure of camaraderie in our friendly neighborhood tavern
yet to call these evenings ordinary was to overlook the priceless value they brought the hours together leaning on each other through the trials and tribulations of young adulthood trying to make sense of all the pressures we felt from a world of parents and professors demanding a commitment to discipline only sure about a few things we liked each other rock roll music cold beer in a cozy bar and talking as long as we could stay awake about all our dreams
last call always came as a temporary let down until one of us casually said the inevitable whos hungry theres a new film coming out called harold kumar go to white castle described as a late night road movie the adventures of two guys from new jersey who get the munchies and are compelled to get to a white castle restaurant at all cost
being from new jersey and having actually spent a few late nights in college making my way to and from white castle i couldnt hold off the rush of memories that came to me though the more i read about the movie it is clear that the similarities to my experiences notwithstanding the film really has nothing to do with me and my friends
beyond the obvious that the two protagonists are from indian and pakistani heritages respectively while we were all white middle class mostly jewish suburbanites perhaps the clearest difference lies in the real reason for finding a late night eating establishment after closing down the bar
it never was about the food
a film that comes closer to what i remember would be barry levinsons diner
a summary of diner from that website goes like this set in 1959 diner shows how five young men resist their adulthood and seek refuge in their beloved diner
the mundane childish and titillating details of their lives are shared
but the golden moments pass and the men shoulder their responsibilities leaving the diner behind
in preparing this post i emailed some of my old friends asking them to share their memories of our precious late night gab sessions over food
theyll hate this but perhaps the years have caught up with them because their responses more accurately a pathetic lack of responses initially made me question my own rosecoloredglasses look backward
one friend who still lives in new jersey wrote that he remembers waking up in the morning feeling terrible from having eaten at a greasy spoon called the white rose system popular for its arteryhardening burgers and for being open 24 hours
its true that we always blamed the burgers for how awful we felt the next day in total denial that alcohol might have had anything to do with it
still i hadnt gleaned what i hoped from the old gang so i had to rely on my own recollections
fortunately there are many fond moments and places to choose from burger joints and pizza parlors after the bars diners and dennys after concerts in the city dives from new brunswick to manhattan just shootin the shit
perhaps the reason why i didnt get a better response from my friends has something to do with geographical distance
whereas we used to all live either together or within minutes of each other we are now spread across the country in new jersey arizona california and washington state
yeah something tells me that if we were all together sitting around a pizza pie and pitchers of beer the stories would flood the place
thats what it was always about
a month ago i posted some commentary on bill cosbys recent rants
the cos has been raising hell about how his fellow africanamericans namely those living in poverty are increasingly responsible for their lack of upward mobility
as a followup i highly recommend this excellent column by none other than henry louis gates jr
in the new york times
gates draws on the cosby comments as well as the now famous dnc speech of barack obama
heres a teaser go into any innercity neighborhood barack obama said in his keynote address to the democratic national convention and folks will tell you that government alone cant teach kids to learn
they know that parents have to parent that children cant achieve unless we raise their expectations and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white
in a speech filled with rousing applause lines it was a line that many black democratic delegates found especially galvanizing
not just because they agreed but because it was a home truth theyd seldom heard a politician say out loud
why has it been so difficult for black leaders to say such things in public without being pilloried for blaming the victim why the huge flap over bill cosbys insistence that black teenagers do their homework stay in school master standard english and stop having babies any black person who frequents a barbershop or beauty parlor in the inner city knows that mr
cosby was only echoing sentiments widely shared in the black community
may this post serve as a notsosubtle plug for the new york times online

a recent dialogue with my 6
75year old son son dad my friend said that its illegal to light fireworks on a day thats not the 4th of july on vashon island

ive been trying to figure out my type of guy for awhile now
just when i think i might have figured it out i think im wrong and im soo confused and im now wondering why guyz dont like me anymore
brandon was trying to think of some reason but i didnt really understand anything he was saying so if anyone could let me in on sumthing like how ive changed or if im a gurl that guyz have just started a conspiracy against
plez im beginning to become desperate oh ya and about the guy i said i liked his personality
i was talking to my mom about it earlier and she said i should push my feelings aside and just wait for awhile until i feel the same way when im around him
the other night i really felt like going on a walk and it was getting pretty dark outside so my mom said i couldnt stay out too long i couldnt go too far and i had to stay on the sidewalk
haha i know shes just protecting me and i woulda done all that newayz but i feel 8 years old
right b4 i left the phone rang and it was brandon
he ended up coming over and we went on a walk together bout halfway thru the nice walktalk he ends up calling his ex gurlfriend one of my best friends who has a thing for my ex boyfriend who is bradons best friend on his cell phone
okay i just wanna let everyone who knows about this little circle and anyone who is smart enuf to figure it out that i really dont care if she goes out w my ex i was just saying that i might not be able to handle it as well and i had alwayz thot that it was a rule not to date ur best friends ex bf or gf unless you ask them first and get complete permission
and even then its really risky but oh well i dont like him anymore nobodys in town its kinda annoying what do you do if you like someone when ur online but ur not sure how much you like them when ur in person
not really looks or anything
what if theyre just too quiet or their too energetic or sumthing and you dont know how youd deal w it but you really like their personality say when ur online idk confusing i need to go on more walks
its fun and i need some more sun and i need to work off the fat im developing from sitting around watching tv and eating
its crazy im craving everything its freaking me out
me and brandon were making chocolate chip cookies cuz once again i had a craving so we made some and i started to have a craving for olives so i went to the fridge and had some olives

vaca was fun but im done w summer and im done w work and i just wanna start school back up to give me sumthing to do so i wont be lazy anymore
altho being lazy has its good points but anywayz
im trying to do wat you said
havent really done much im jst psyching myself up for it lol not but im trying i was talking to someone the other day and he and his gf have been dating for quiet sometime now and i told him i wasnt looking for love at the age of 15 and he basically yelled at me online
ya know w all caps why the heck do you have a bf then and i really dont know wat i should be looking for
mayb im not trying hard enuf but mayb im putting too much into it i really dont know
im trying to be more comfortable w my blog
trying to trust you all more its just i think my problem is saying something on here and having the wrong person read it and then them saying sumthing about it and me getting myself in a load of crap that i really didnt need to get myself in in the first place

dang the storms have been bad lately
starting to scare me a bit
but the sky was gorgeous tonight i work on friday so if you wanna come by and see me that would be just peachy
47 i really dont have much to say
we got stuck out in the storm in our car in a parking lot at the south side of town
this old lady was in her car in the middle of the street absolutely traumatized
we ended up driving her home cuz she was so scared
i felt bad for her
my throat hurts again which really sux cuz i just got over being sick
okay well i cant think of anything else and sry its so short but there was only one big thing
well ill be seein ya all later buh bye much love xoxoxoxo
haha weird title i know
but its mainly cuz my tooth hurts really bad
argh lol wow todays storm was crazy we got stuck out in our car during it
our car was like moving back and forth cuz of the wind
we ended up pulling over into a parking lot to be alittle safer i guess
but anywayz there was this poor old lady out in the middle of the street and she was like freakin out
she ran into quite a few things but she pulled over to where my dad could get in and talk to her to get her to calm down
anwyayz we ended up driving her home and we hope shes okay now
so prayers out to her yesterday was fun
i went over to my grandmas house to celebrate my mommys birthday which is today and we had cake and stuff and lots of food
then we went and picked up cody in my grandmas huge car
when we pulled up his mom and his little sister jumped in next to me and was like
take us w you you have enough room
lol it was great but anwyayz cody came w us downtown and we met up w cj and andrew after much searching
we got caught in the rain but it wasnt bad
we tried lookin for brandon in the dark but it didnt really work out and we ended up never finding him
hmmm i cant really think of anything else thats been goin on
haha this afternoon we got home after the storm and checked the answering machine for messages and my mom had one that had a woman a man and a little kid singing happy birthday to her but didnt say who it was
we just assumed it was my uncle and his family
but i was talkin to cody later and it was his mom brian and his little sister kendall
it was hilarious when we found out sick of waiting cya later guyz leave a comment luv ya xoxoxo
went to see dodgeball tonight and it was purty fun
the movie kinda sucked cuz it was full of too much crap but it had some funny parts i guess
anywayz i had fun w the company tho so its all good then we were gonna walk over to nicks pizza afterwords and hang out but ended up there almost being a fight and all this other crap between a couple guyz there and it was a mess
they were all potty mouths too but by the time we got over to nicks it was like 30 min
till i was getting picked up so we didnt get to stay there very long lol it was kinda humorous tho
why does it take guyz so long to ask you out idk wat they are waiting for
oh well i need to wait anywayz to work somethings out w someone else b4 i can have anything happen honestly
i really wish ppl would see eye to eye w me more often but i guess we cant all be that lucky so i honestly pray to god that this someone sees where im comin from and if not that i can just move on wo any guilt
ya so sam just got back from being outta town for like a week and he was gonna come to the movies cuz hes gonna be leaving tomorrow for another week but noooo he has been gone from the house for like 3 weeks and wanted to stay home and sit around okay
we sam i worked yesterday w michael and tyler for like 3 hours so it was purty fun
they talk alot lol bout random stuff too but ive discovered tonight that most guyz do
tyler had me try vanilla mello yellow and michael made me try strawberry coke
they were both purty good but i liked the strawberry coke better
see we have these different syrups that we put in some of our smoothies so when were not that busy i go up and get a drink and squirt some syrup in it
dont have too much to say right now
besides i cant stay on much longer but ill try and write more later luv ya all a bunch xoxo
i have to say last years was better
mayb bc of the new crush and the stalkerish attitude lol altho i do have to say i greatly enjoyed the speech excersizes we did
i specially enjoyed ripping up my cool card and playing ride the pony
that was probably my favorite
i had 3 things i could have done tonight
go to lost at church
basically where they drop you off in the middle of no where with a group and you gotta find ur way back to the church but they leave you w a little poket money
go to the drive in w cody and his dgroup and the gurlz dgroup that hangs out w them or 3
to go over to tjs house
wat does samantha end up doing staying home w her parents and going to subway wowness
im fun i really dont have much to say
sry most of the juicy stuff goes in my diary so im not lettin any of that out
im having weird feelings about everything but im not gonna talk about them
cuz no one probly cares lol 2
i just dont wanna 3
fact is i really dont know wat to say about them thanx tj for the comments about my dad
that just totally rox and its awesome and ya you know it was cool lol no one can hurt me half as bad as i hurt myself that quote basically shows my personality for the past month or two and present cept i dont listen to it and i continue hurting myself
im so messed up right now
life is so strange or is it me probly the latter any comments
isnt it funny how you can love someone to death one day and then the very next loathe them enuf to want to never see them again i really dont think it is
but i can tell you it sux
i hear from some i care too much
that i need to go w the flow and just let things role off my back
that i let things get to me too easily and im one of the few ppl who have such a caring attitude and that its a blessing and a curse at the same time dont you hate those just like being hott
hehe i love you kid but
dun dun dun some also say i dont care enuf
i let ppl slide w just a sorry which is just a word coming outta their mouths and its just dripping w disrespect and unimportance
the one you thot cared is really just manipulating you into their little slave cuz youve had them on a pedestal for as long as uve known them and its coming back and slapping you in the face
whoa now i totally got way off
thats me venting wo names i was reading this stupid mythology thing and found myself acting very blondish when it took me a chapter to realize why echo was named echo and why she was cursed w only the ability to repeat wat others say instead of having speech for herself
but on the smart side of things
going back to my natural brunette color i found the story about cupid and psyche very interesting how she let her sisters convince her that he was something he wasnt and she almost lost him forever
she went to great lengths to get him back of course but idk its weird how ppl influence you into thinking one thing when its something totally different
ya know those ppl that came up w this stuff had a good idea on how to fix how things happened
i really think its all bogus but its kinda interesting some of the stories they think of
omg i was totally thinking about how frikin scary would it be to suddenly like turn into a tree
wow anywayz i hate how guyz dont understand the meaning of gurlz time of the month
oh well they will jst never understand and i guess ill just have to deal w that
thank you for listening to one of sams boring blogs but plez leave a comment and let me know wat u think i should do or who u think i am or if you think i should just shut up
run away to the beach
and figure it out myself or if anyone agrees w me when i say i feel like im sounding like a certain someone
hmmm much homework for you all hehe luv you guyz
but i had some yummy chinese food for dinner and now i am stuffed
pete and i are going to watch kill bill the first one
we havent seen it yet
having to work on saturdays is horrible esp
i mean it just shouldnt be allowed
its nice to earn some money but when its so sunny and all i wanna do is be outside working just isnt fun
i met a cool girl at work today though
she made work a bit more enjoyable
i have to work next saturday too nbsp
ready to gonbsp
me marcus and mel at the japanese restaurantnbsp
look at that all smilesnbsp
lookin dazed and confusednbsp
gettin some kissesnbsp
marcus and i at their shindignbsp
mel and i at dinnernbsp
melita and machikonbsp
everyone piling in for the picturenbsp
machiko and marcus the happy couplenbsp
me mel yashna machiko and mark at the wine barnbsp
isnt machiko just adorable in this picnbsp
machiko melita and i dressed to go out in chapel thrillnbsp
so the other night there was this huge nasty spider on my kitchen ceiling
since pete was here i asked him to kindly get it and put it outside or kill it
well being the nicest mr
peacelover that he is he said that he wasnt going to kill it
ok i can understand that but at least get it down right well because the damn thing was in a little corner like most spiders are he was hard to get down
i could not sleep knowing that this spider was possibly making babies and in the morning i would have to kill 12 not just 1 so i worked up enough nerve to kill the damn thing
now i feel bad because pete is so sensitive when it comes to animals and insects
animals are one thing but insects man i can smash an insect or spider in no time and not think twice about it or so i thought till now
so people tell me what you think
to kill the spider or not to kill the spider one of my friends gave me a good recommendation and said get a glass jar and trap the spider in that and then slide a piece of paper up behind the back of the jar and the spider will fall in that and then you can throw him out
i think next time i will have to try that
this week has been very exhausting at school
its really hard sitting in lecture all day listening to these wonderful designers who are so famous and successful and not being able to do anything about it
i know that it all just takes time and commitment but i am ready to start working and really learning hands on
this week is mainly business lectures how to set up your own business what kinds of accounting software to use all the specification licensing trade information
one of the designers who set up her company after graduating from college went on to be very successful and was contacted by ppl in japan to go over there and design restaurants watches clothes etc
she said that once you are a designer the japanese ask you to design many different things not just interiors
well i am starting on gathering information for my first project
i think it will be so exciting but at the same time kind of difficult
its only a 3 star hotel and its main competition are all 5 star hotels
but this beach resort has much better beaches and a better location so i need to start sourcing asap
tomorrow we will get the client brief and then i can start on my design analysis
we have a long weekend friday and monday off yeah i can catch up on sleep on saturday after work i am going to sheffield to visit petes family
ill meet his grandmother who is going blind
i feel so sorry for her she wants to meet me and see pete one more time before she is completely blind
also petes dads birthday is coming up
i have no clue what to get men for presents esp
since i dont know him that well
i dont want to get him anything cheesy ya know any suggestions oh i signed up for some online courses like i have time i know but they are free and i think i will be able to learn alot
i can take courses such as html photoshop dreamweaver etc it may be useful so that i can set up my own website someday
i am trying to add this little tracking device hit button thing and its not working
we found out what our last and final project at klc will be
a beach resort in antigua to check out the resort go to www
com posted by hello
so i am finally trying to get together a portfolio to show prospective companies
after looking through all my projects its really hard to put something in a portfolio when you think its crap
i wish i had more time to redo so many projects
but oh well lets just hope that somebody out there somewhere wants to hire me soon hee hee posted by hello
kill bill was actually pretty good
i liked it but i cant stand sequels to movies
they are never as good as the first and i hate waiting months for the next one to come out
by the time they come out ive forgotten half of the plot of the first one
silly picture of mike and missynbsp
karen and i at the mexican restaurant bar in richmond being stupid smiling with limes in our mouths
yes karen is wearing a hula skirt
we had a not so surprise congratulations you got into law school party for her
the book we got her was called yay you nbsp
and here are her famous eggs to go
breakfast in a hurry have some eggs to go and youll be on your way in no time gotta love missynbsp
while i was at home for easter i went up to richmond to visit karen and missy
i job shadowed missy at work for a couple of days and this is a picture of missy eating her breakfast from a paper cup
i am completely stuffed its one of those yum im so stuffed and i just wanna sit back and watch a movie and not do anything kind of stuffed not one of those oh i think i ate too much and am going to have a tummy ache one so thats good
pete and i went out to this indian restaurant we hadnt been to before and just pigged out
then we walked all the way to blockbuster and we were going to rent the last samuri walked up to the counter and everything and
i had forgotten my card and i also had petes card from the last time we went to bb so we had to walk all the way back empty handed
so now i think ill have to actually do some more work
can you believe that i cant just give them my name and then rent the videos they needed a pic id and i didnt bring my wallet out so no luck there
i got my grades back from my last project and i did pretty well
was quite chuffed as everyone here says
my tutor said that my presentation was so strong and convincing that he thought i had come from a marketing background
anyway just spent the last 3 hours working on my portfolio and it wasnt even a real portfolio its just one done on powerpoint so that i can send it to prospective employers
i am quite happy with it but i just need to change a few things
oh and no it didnt take me 3 hours to set up the pp thing i am fine with that it was doing things on adobe photoshop that took me so long
anyway now back to my last project
i really cant wait for school to be through
to think that my evenings will actually be free my own time sounds like paradise oh another good thing it looks like ill be going to japan this summer yeah im running out of my cosmetics anyway and i only trust the japanese kind for my skin
lots of catching up with ppl and relatives
one of my friends is getting married
so pete and i are just sitting here having a lovely dinner when all of a sudden we hear a huge crack and look up to see that our bay window in the living room has a gigantic hole in the window some fnut must have thrown a rock through our window
who the hell would do that to us we have no friends or enemies in luton everyone we hang out with live in london
let me just tell you one thing
luton sux it is the worst place ha so at least you guys wont want to come and visit me
anyway had a nice weekend in sheffield
but i somehow managed to pull a muscle in my back and it hurts like shit so i dont know what to do and all i want is sympathy
what do you do for a pulled muscle never had one before
well i just applied for two jobs today but im not holding my breath
one was for a company in london and another was for a company in los angelos
so what i really shouldve been doing was my work for my final project but im thinking finding a job is a little more important
so pete informs me that our last day in this flat is july 13th ok thats only a little more than a month left
what are we going to do hum
im supposed to have all this shit figured out by now but of course things never happen like you plan so ive stopped planning
everyone says it will all fall into place but i have yet to see that happen
i am waiting anxiously for my dream job to jump into my lap
i dont know whether to stay here in london with pete or go back to the states and get a job there
im so torn and have no clue
sometimes i just wish that someone would make up my mind for me because i change mine every second
for the time being i guess just applying for jobs in london and the states will be good
but i just dont know
why give up a good thing when nothings wrong ya know hmmm
lots to think about but after doing some thinking over the past 9 months i havent come up with an answer so how will one more month give me the answer yeah right
i have to get up tomorrow at 7 and commute 2 hours to school and work on my last project
i just started checking out airline prices for a flight home and they start around 1200 that is just insane i was able to fly from london to charlotte roundtrip for about 600 around christmas and thats the busiest time of the year how could the price jump up to 1200 omg
what am i going to do hmmm
it is gorgeous outside absolutely beautiful
and i have to be inside drawing all day how annoying i cannot wait for this project to be over
i have never done anything that consumes my life 24 hrs a day
i have already had so many dreams about this project the presentation the design
isnt that crazy oh on the good side of things i got an email from an interior design company in california who is interested in seeing my portfolio yeah i would love to move to cali good weather good food and right by the ocean
perfect keep your fingers crossed
i sent her my portfolio yesterday
well i turned in my last project today
yeah its all over tomorrow i am first up for presentations so at least ill get it over with quickly
but man am i tired i got an email back from the interior design company out in la and she liked my portfolio yay but i think she is looking to hire someone immediately and because i will not be back in the states till mid july i dont know
but yes i finally bought my tix home for july 10th so i will finally after 3 years be stateside again
im getting all excited just thinking about it
well for those of you unacquainted with my travels over the past year im current in grad school at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign
its not quite la tech but i make do
ive been working on some pretty esoteric problems in power systems so im pretty sure any more details about what im doing would be cause for some type of beating
lately i havent been able to engage in anything of any real excitement hereunless eating funnel cake while listening to a demolition derby counts due to a pretty strict regimen of work and little sleep but im certainly up for reading about someone else having the fun im missing
theres also an open invitation to come up and watch me study for my qualifying exam in november
yes that goes for all of you
i can only assume that everyones elses silence is out of awe at the power of my first post
please dont let that stop you
people will want to read your posts even if they arent as amazing as mine our readers are realistic
i much prefer that opening to lucass a long time ago in a galaxy far far away but i have to admit that one of my favorite parts of a very funny speech a friend of mine used to give revolves around the fact that although star wars is futuristic its supposed to have happened in the past
remind me and ill tell you the joke sometime
or if you have ten minutes do yourself a favor and watch the speech
trying to get a list together and hopefully get at least some mild timeframes for matts last party as a free man excepting of course the night before his fune
last conversations put the approximate date of the gathering near march 12th or march 19th
the two major venues i heard mention are las vegas and new orleans
im mostly inclined to go with a majority view but please be aware that not everyone who gets a voice has access to this forum
my personal vote for both financial and lazy reasons is new orleans
with a good crowd its hard to beat the french quarter and uptown for drinks and tomfoolery
assuming we could get people to land in new orleans at close to the same times or a couple of times im not opposed to providing transportation for the weekend
i know golf courses and paintball facilities within 45 minutes of new orleans
im sure i can speak with a few friends to find the right gentlemans establishments for poor little engaged matt
anyway vegas is also an option i just have to do more research for it
james lileks has his problems especially as a blogger but he deserves a special place in the web hall of fame for his gallery of regrettable foods
do yourself a favor and check out meat meat meat warning probably better if you arent wolfing down a meatloaf sandwich while viewing this
and dont do it at work unless you coworkers are accustomed to unexplained giggling interspersed with the occasional guffaw
ive just been reading toquevilles democracy in america for those of you with portable devices try here and i must say its an amazingly relevant book given its age though maybe im just overwhelmed by my first real poli
though im not sure if the book even qualifies as poli
ill publish some quotes later when i have the book in front of me
i cant believe i went through my entire high school and undergraduate career without even hearing mention of it
check out the latest department of energy budget here
the amusing part comes from the amount spent on the federal energy regulatory commission or the ferc which sounds more appropriately ominous
any guesses as to how much money the doe gives to ferc the answer 0
doe gives roughly 8 billion dollars to weapons research and zip to the guys who have arguably the most influence on how much power costs in your home and how to prevent things like blackouts
this is why ferc can only hire starting engineers at 38000 whereas the national average starting salary for electrical engineers is around 50000 its the 3rd most lucrative degree available
its pretty sad that such a potentially meaningful job has such poor salaries
and might explain some of the illthoughtout work smd anyone they produce

evolutionism propaganda you heard it here firstthe concept of evolution is responsible for the spread of aids they argued that aids is constantly evolving and if it werent for darwin we wouldnt understand why and thus would be helpless in treating the disease they conveniently neglect to point out that darwinistic propaganda equating us with animals might have helped to spread the disease in the first place
friday was simply great i did wear a saree after all
since i live close to work about a 5 min drive my friends made me go home and change into a saree
luckily my mum was at home so she draped the saree for me
the weekend was pretty busy
i met up with a few of my old office friends on sunday after nearly 2 years
it was a huge effort on ashs part to get all of us together but she did it nevertheless
it was really nice catching up on what has been going on and most surprising was after we spoke for sometime we realized most of our colleagues in office are either married or have a baby we all met up at barista and sat there for about 2 hours just catching up on what we had missed
jerry is now a manager doing strategic planning playing sin o dhanya and ash are trainers bryan is a quality analyst anne is back in college and sujit and conrad are doing very well for themselves
gayathri who apparently didnt turn up on sunday is now in charge of training
three years back all of us just out of college looking for some place to start our careers
we got to know each other better and sooner than we realized we were good friends
all of us were in one team fortunately j and we continued to work together
being our first job every one was very enthusiastic especially ash she would come to work even on her days off our manager had to literally drive her back home
it was these friends who like a dose of caffeine kept me awake during night shifts 230 am 1130 am
they were one of the reasons i looked forward to going to work and the salary also 0 we used to go sometimes to a resort on team outings and we used to have a ball
getting back to work next morning was a problem but thats beside the point
little by little people started leaving sujit was the first one and then anne then connie and brian and then me
ash gayathri dhanya and jerry still work in the same place
as months and years went by we lost touch everyone was so busy doing their own thing but the evening out on sunday was an icebreaker
it was like reliving the good times we had how this first job has molded our future our personality and not forgetting the precious friends we made
there is nothing better than the pleasant memories you carry with you as you move ahead in life
12th august after a long thought about what to post in my second blog i am still clueless and my imagination seems to abscond when i need it the most
well here i go anyway
just another day at work that too not too much of it
its not very nice when you finish your work at the beginning of that day and then you have about 34 hours left with nothing to do
i wish i could go home instead l 13th august i am back again this is the second day and its taken me around 24 hours to write a few lines
since the indian independence day falls on a sunday waste of a good public holiday we are having independence day celebrations in office today
to celebrate the spirit of independence we decided to dress in indian traditional clothes
i conveniently forgot about it and realized this just before i could leave from home this morning and it was too late to decide to wear a saree
the saree is the indian traditional dress worn by the women
it is usually 56 yards longs and is draped around the waist in a very beautiful and elegant way which i dont think i will ever be able to master
it takes me hours to wear the saree and even after that it looks like ive just wrapped a bed sheet around myselfl
a saree comes in different fabrics chiffon georgette silk and cotton to name a few
there is a particular type of saree with a lot of gold thread woven in the fabric this is called zari and it is the most beautiful indian dress i have ever seen
everything is so colorful here weve got the indian flags all over the office and everyone looks so bright and beautiful in indian clothes
im off to celebrate our independence

im 13 years old now and one person said you are a teenager right now and it is going to be a hard moment in ur life
first time i dont really expecting that moment coz i know its going to hard but right now i feel it
im going to be a teenager and im starting to feel the difference from childhood into teenagerhood
like she said its going to hard
i know its just the beggining and its hard enough for me
my mum is a great woman she passed a very terrible childhood with her mother and she is a very great mother for me right now
thats why i adore her so much

hi everyone im new in here
as mentioned in the email no game this week i have to research a 13th century poem for a final paper
i enjoy the work but id much rather have swashbuckling adventure in wintery hillsfar
harpers harpers they really care
harpers harpers stay in motion
harpers harpers pins of green
harpers harpers enter the scene
harpers harpers formed by a bard
what a bard you got to be fucking kidding me right a bard jesus christ were screwed
in an earlier post johnathan said and then what of gregory does he feel a pull to move beyond his comfort zone or is it a natural evolution for him to remain in the central heartlands of faerun patrolling the darkness that lurks therein
there is room for everyone and for every player in the saga glory awaits
but what glory will that be the local hero the regional hero the hero of the land the hero of a world or the hero of the multiverse to respond to this in a way i would say that gregory is really having to make a sort of leap of faith to swallow all of this extraplanar stuff
he gets it and doesnt get it at the same time
he can understand the world as being a large and changing place but seeing father castillion in the ethereal plane
to gregory it was basically like talking to a ghost and that is just creepy
he understands gods but for there to be something bigger than gods that can take a whole planet and put it in the middle of a nothingness place its just a bit much
even though he is actually experiencing it he is still kind of thinking in the back of his mind yeah
and what glory will he find local hero multiverse he would most likely never expect to rise above something between hero of the land and hero of the world
frankly because he doesnt really seeunderstand the whole multiverse thing and even being hero of the world is kind of pretentious in his eyes
id post this on the rtg blog but i cant post there
could someone either post or email me the resolution to the catillian situation as the original hook of our adventure im kind of curious
posted by idic 10232003 125331 pm castillion was rescued during the collapse by unnamed friends and is now alive and well in the ethereal
the party talked with him in the office of din dal kut who resides on a splinter plane
it seems that when thulos took terranel the local group of the multiverse was torn away with it and all exist as a miniature multiverse in the inbetweenplace
a side result of this occurence is that according to castillion the dead have nowhere to go and have been gathering at an unknown city for millenia
castillion is now dedicated to renewing contact with the gods if possible
he has recommened that the party join forces with the harpers a secret society formed by the last elven bard at the very end of the great retreat
upon seeing calleum and the banner of heironeous in a magical viewing paintingframe on din dal kuts office wall burne leapt to join his mentor and was last seen in a battle in rashemen one of the lands that borders the far east
the act broke the portal and the party was unable to follow
also castillon is ians father
having reached the end of the original journey ian and gregory are beginning to question if they should continue or return to tilverton to tell of castillions demise which was castillions request as the truth would be too difficult to understand
players have the option of sending their character off to do something longterm and create and play a new character
the world stage has expanded wide enough to accomodate such
once the false murder rap is resolved the party may see the breaking of the original fellowship but the beginning of a much larger worldspanning epic
posted by harmony 10232003 020031 pm
the answer to the first question lies with master po the answer to the second is sister jayna the priestess who took over after castillion departed
it seems odd to think of brother ian as having a father
he seems like the type that just sprouted out of the ground
and if fc really is his father then why didnt he claim him earlier who is his mother
since our next game is the weekend of halloween why dont we all dress up like our characters next session
hillsfar ruled by lord malthiir believed by the party to be a former gangcrime lord who came to power by unknown means
the red plumes an army of mercenaries recently added to a preexisting smaller force news its victory over the most recent orc attack of which there have been three so far in the region is spreading attracting more enlistees
the local thieves guild a member of which helped acquire the antidote for ian and rhanellus the hand a mysterious order of deadly monks and assassins kshaal a powerful unidentified figure who apparently pulls many strings according to luc the name is reminiscent of those used by dragons the zhentarim an order of sorcerers who actively seek power rumor suggests that they are on the verge of an internal struggle the harpers a centuriesold secret society that seeks a way to restore faerun jalal the elvendesignated watcherkeeper of cormanthor garovia a recentlyawakened corrupted druid whereabouts unknown orcs thousands of which live north of the moonsea the attack on hillsfar is the third such action in the past year the citadel of the raven a tower complex where resides lividia who has been linked to rhanellus the sacking of shadowdale keech an addictive plant the recent orc invasion possible agents within the red plumes and the foreign goblin machinists lizard folk of which nothing is known except they attacked the party during the interrogation of a keechaddicted red plume guard plus various individual contacts the party has met or heard of
if email is iffy we can always use this handy blog
i will make an effort to deliver announcements both here and by email
perhaps we can have it that if an email is sent out that a confirmation email can be sent back
i dont know why it didnt go through or why no one received it
the only way ben knew what he did is because i spoke to him on thursday
im going to stop using the netscape account though if everyone could change my email to madduxmiryahoo
com i would appreciate it
mir ben said something about 5050
regardless we missed you hope your day was a good one
father castillion has been found and the end of the battle of hillsfar was remembered in which everyone earned an average of 2000 xp and a few leveled
also scott got some much needed rest
i dont know how long rtg will last
i dont see a reason to end it as i am presently committed to gaming as a regular activity in my life
players may come and go but i will be writing and running some sort of game as long as people want to participate in such
posted by harmony 10152003 033100 pm so does that mean rtg will last until 2005 posted by hotcocoa 10152003 025613 pm at my current pace i will graduate in either dec 05 or may 06
sure takes a long time to earn 48 credits
posted by harmony 10152003 114641 am
and as far as characters go i like luc i want to see where her story goes ive committed over 2 years to seeing how she would develop and i want to see the ending
i feel like i owe it to her
and i dont even believe that duellacathata is actually dead
i cant believe that powerful of a magic user wouldnt have a backup plan in case her body was destroyed
to be fair duellacathata didnt directly frame the party that was supposedly the desire of kshaal or rather hisherits representative
duellacathata just wanted falchez dead and buried in his familys magically sealed tomb
ashes of course tell no tales
im going to stick with ian for now
but having the choice is quite cool
welcome scott glad you were able to get in this time
let me know if you have any further trouble
any chance we could just teleport to the dragons graveyard and then teleport back cause damn its a long way back south in the opposite direction of everything else we want to see even by way of the cave network previously mentioned
after we find out about castillian i say we clear our names expose the conspiracy report the lizard men sighting determine burnes fate go destroy the keech fields and maybe lividia find a big enough city where we can all train and otherwise increase our skills not necessarily in that order but close enough
was the hand mentioned as possibly being involved in our current predicament in regards to the murder weve been accused of cant believe that zhenterem bitch killed that banker and framed us for the murder just so she could raise him from the dead to steal from his own deceased grandmother
way to go rhanellus burn baby burn
once the party discovers what happened to castillion a mystery that technically matters directly to only two present characters gregory and ian the group will be at an interesting crux what next the party is now international in membership and global and beyond in awareness of the world
the mysteries and challenges that have been placed on the table are definitely different from how the story began
this may be frustrating to some and i understand the desire for simplicity lets just get the ring to mount doom but it was always my intention to create a broad organic world within which various characters could pursue adventure and glory
i had done the single throughline campaign before i was interested in trying something with fewer if any boundaries
the catch though is that the game began with certain set archetypes if you will various local yokels and a couple of wild cards who set out to figure something out and those archetypes may very reasonably strain a bit at the edges as they move beyond the comfort zone of what they originally intended and expected to do
which is kind of my point what do the players feel about their characters comfort zones of the current party fennie and connor are the most likely to pursue adventure for its own sake
rhanellus has a personal journey to take that seems at the moment to be connected to the big picture in some unknown way
adan has a spiritual calling to right what has been changed and it is natural for him to roam the world on that quest
luc like rhanellus has a personal journey that seems linked somehow to the events of the world specifically the oftenmentioned return of the demon kings
but then there are other issues connor would probably like to find the other two thirds of the codex one day fennie would like to put this map to the dragons graveyard to use before she dies luc would like to know who made her a key and can it be undone and rhanellus wants to go wherever clues lead him to his own selfknowledge
each of these goals is unlike the world in crisis situation not only individual and unique but geographically diverse to the point candlekeep the citadel of the raven the mountains on the other side of the dalelands cormyr zhentil keep and the distant land of thay
talk about an indiana jones red line map crawl
and then what of gregory does he feel a pull to move beyond his comfort zone or is it a natural evolution for him to remain in the central heartlands of faerun patrolling the darkness that lurks therein likewise what of ian should he return to the monastery and report what he has learned or is he a free agent im not declaring anything here just sharing some observations from this side of the screen
what we have now is the result of something i have personally always wanted to do but never tried a game world that spans centuries nations and even continents and oceans
there is room for everyone and for every player in the saga glory awaits
but what glory will that be the local hero the regional hero the hero of the land the hero of a world or the hero of the multiverse certainly questions worth thinking about
as i mentioned in the previous post all characters are welcome to follow their path to glory from the point where they started
likewise players are free to create new heroes should their characters evolve onto a path unique to themselves
unless a character dies everyone who has been in the world will still be an active and prominent participant in the world even if they are not represented in a game session
boris borovich and burne trinson are out there even now making choices that matter
the same could be said of any character that chose to veer off on his or her own
personally i like all the characters
i enjoy their choices and their actions both their desires and the things they dont really give a flying fig about
all are welcome to do as they please as they follow their own road to glory
referring to johnathans post i think that the party clearly does not have the same goals
this is fine mind you but needs pointing out none the less
personally i just dont feel that gregory has evolved enough within himself to be able to broaden the lensscope for him
he is still very much following his own set of goals
some of which are shared by other party members such as finding castillion but like the majority of the party he seems to have his own agenda
mon oct 06 054417 pm hot chocolate oh burne how i miss thee and thine control over ye big mouthed monk
mon oct 06 041935 pm harmony baggins
and so it was that burne lived out his years with wife and kids in the land of chesterfieldius
in case youre curious after pursuing various leads regarding both their recent memory loss and the murder they are suspected of committing the party has made a curious and partially unexplained bargain with several illithids who promise to restore their memories an act which may resolve several questions one of which being the location and activities of the missing burne
mon oct 06 032203 pm john robinson rtg notebook my famousinfamous notebook is currently enroute to mr
haley via a courier who will exchange for some sg1 dvds when he next attends a noncancelled hand of shiva session
to paraphrase jms of b5 fame one might consider this the story of a platoon in wwii
whatever happens to the platoon the story of wwii goes on often dwarfing the individual soldier
perhaps the best one can hope for is to be present at midway or help raise the flag on iwo jima or be the bombadier on the enola gay
regardless there are two valid choices either to focus only on ones own mission and interests or to expand that focus to include the scope and detail of the war in part or in its entirety
what the player finds entertaining rewarding and manageable is often defined by what he or she chooses to be specifically relevant to the character
of course in a party of seven characters there are seven separate lists of what is relevant
if one is to remain with a party and not go off on ones own which would be perfectly acceptable except that it would result in leaving the game there is an argument to be made for being aware of what the other six individuals deem relevant to them
otherwise one is watching choices without clear motivation and the result can be a frustrating chaos
thus the list of what one needs to know to function within the story grows a little bit longer
by the way as a general note if any player starts to feel that his or her character would at some point decide that its more logical to leave the party and pursue his or her own agenda it is perfectly acceptable for the player to create another character that will join the party and take the previous characters place
theres no rule that says you must stay with one character throughout
once provided with the players basic guidelinesrequests i would npc the character somewhere out in the world until such a time that the player wanted that character to return
alternately the path of the absent character might later intersect with the party again and for a time the player could play both until one left again hopefully this would only be a session or two
anway just a random thing to toss out there
even though it began as a simple mystery of what happened to father castillion the camera has pulled back far enough now that almost all the world is in play
thus my interest in launching some side games that occur elsewhere in the worlds history
this post like many stories seems to have grown with the telling
dude i have no idea where that notebook is now but i get your point
i can keep most of it in my head its just such an epic and i have such a hard time pronouncing the names
mon oct 06 121148 pm hot chocolate and the cast still remaining from the first season are scott moran gregory miriam maddux luc ben haley brother ian jimi harrell rhanellus the scoobys and of course the god of us all johnathan shipley

mon oct 06 100010 am hot chocolate how many years have weve been playing now mon oct 06 091103 am harmony baggins thanks chocolate
though a game isnt any good without players to make it so
sun oct 05 074658 pm hot chocolate great game johnathan
perhaps you can make notes to yourself during the game as john did
i supplied notebooks and folders to everyone at the beginning of the campaign for that purpose
very interesting but hard to keep in head all at once

these two new blogs for glory and shiva have been designed for discussion about the respective games
this will provide a place for us to discuss our characters the current plot threads and perhaps even come up with some answers to the puzzles that have been presented to us
it may also serve as a way for the respective game masters to get a feel of where the group is heading
my original and grander plans for ahvanet may be on hold indefinitely rather than wait until the whole thing comes together i decided to go ahead with the blogging portion
please keep the random tomfoolery to a minimum so that we can maintain focus weve got circle of irony for that
god hates his day job
hey is this thing on hello
hey folks check your email no game today
apologies to all explanations within
i will be there for the entire game this week
even funnier if you replace the guys with a drow a beholder and an illithid
joke moved to circle of irony err
forget it ever existed these are not the droids youre looking for
i will be at the next game
the road to glory is currently a quiet one it seems
hey you buckle your swashes someplace else pal this is a family friendly joint
man that was like one of the best games ever
this is what i also look for in relationships no more messy inky towels and hands easy break down and assembly customizing evolving map standard one inch 1 grids
this makes me want to run a dungeon crawl again tacttiles

0 will represent 8 different geographic regions of faerun none of them tilverton
also the blood of tilvernus is no longer present
only two witnesses remain of the winters edge festival that initiated the long road to glory
including the three new additions the campaign has produced 12 unique player characters so far
what new future souls may join the present struggle remains to be seen
but the spirit of the fellowship remains so long as we hold true to the purpose of the one we sought and found
castillions path is much like our own he left his home with small but noble intent but now walks a much longer road towards a goal of global cosmic significance
having acquired the proof needed to clear themselves of the murder charge the party accepted an offer from the shadowy kshaal to eliminate the wouldbe crimelord who framed the party
given the discovery made after the raid on griesons heavily protected auction it is unclear if the party succeeded
meanwhile ian and gregory have decided to return to tilverton to deliver an altered version of events namely that castillion died in shadowdale when in fact he did not
on the eve of a rumored message arriving from the east the party has been invited to join the mysterious harpers it is unknown if they will accept
what is known is that the original fellowship that departed from tilverton is broken and that three strangers may be joining the remaining heroes as they take their first steps towards entering the ranks of those who hope to achieve the healing or perhaps the ultimate restoration of faerun

yuggoth fungi demon lord starting to invade higher reaches of underdark
why possibilities demons in general emboldended by wane of magic and the rise of human conflict seeking to take advantage of both freed from imprisonment from magical ward failed now from magics wane seismic activity zhenterum foolishness seeking to infect at least one creature which might be able to leave local group thereby preserving its essence prior to when the thulos cthulhu conflict comes to a head fleeing from something worse down below ian not of the blood of tilvernus not of this world union of father castillian and sister jara
is he not of the blood of tilvernus as well is he from beyond the local group andor sister jara master po knows more of ians heritage potential origins will possibly guide ian to greater power energy etc
manticore cave from 2 years prior what was the object that master po picked up where when was the place we had been transported to other caves with manticore imagery suggested human presence long before what was know some caves were gone when we tried to visit them again
possible connection with original manticore cave displacement of time and space group has been teleported on several occasions through time and space
how possibilities zhenterum meddling at least one chronomancer exists maybe more general instability of faerun magically physically due to local group issue someone in the group nexus of some sort luc rhanellous what happened to the obliat connection to dragons graveyard have others tried to get it before or to graveyard such as zhenterum shadow of simerius demon lords what happened to all the dragons if dragons and faeries were the first inhabitants of faerun what were the next when did manticore appear manticore from somewhere else did this happen before or after the removal of faerun from the prime material plane into the local group where did the elves go did they know about the local group situation did it predate their depature from the human occupied lands was there a falling out between their race and the drow how do the illithids figure into all this there are apparently evil and less evil benevloent kinds do they truly seek to rule faerun if so how what if any allies to they possess zhenterum and harpers have much ancient and magical knowledge will have the illithids attempt to join ally subvert infiltrate destroy either group to further their own ends is party x good or evil sinister or just meddlesome do they possess power to be reckoned with have the zhenterum approached them can lividia be beaten by the likes of us or should we ally ourselves with others before taking her on all those of the blood of tilvernus in the group have departed said group
coincidence this bloodline is physically powerful in at least one way used it to permanently seal the beast in the ruined tower near shadowdale
will the blood be used again for similiar uses is anyone seeking us out for this very reason was tilvernus a god demigod or powerful hero when did he walk faerun before or after the creation of the local group what others of his ilk strode our lands in times past what are the harpers true intentions are they any better than the zhenterum seem more benevolent compassionate connection to adens patron deity is ian becoming considered as a harper by virtue of wearing the pin

its odd and sad mary magdalene is here but where are peter and judas
nobody reads this damn thing anyway so ill attempt to be poetic and also because johnathan challenged me once long ago about knowing the meaning of love
when we love and we feel that sense of spiritual understanding that interweaving of self and we hold each other and cry
crying for joy because of what we have been given the gift that we sense so few have had and crying knowing that death time or own forgetfulness of that moment will take it away
we argue about the petty meaningless issues that make up our justification for an existence and forget the times when we were angels and knowing that was all that mattered
we look back in our lives and laugh
laugh because of the love that we have encountered the beauty we have seen and for each ending we know there is a beginning and the understanding that the cycle will continually renew
or as john lennon would put it why on earth are we here surely not to live in pain and fear
why are earth are you over there when youre everywhere
come and get your share

youve come a long way baby before all of this happened i was extremely interested in posing silvas said in an interview posted on the playboy web site
i have the utmost respect for the entire company and i believe posing for playboy is the american dream for a woman
this is very scary and john not from salon magazine
what about protests and freedom of speech are we all supposed to sit there like robots while someone speaks isnt decorum an option rather than a legal issue httpabcnews
speaking of russia what in the world is going on here russia became a junior member of nato recently like 2 days ago
correct if im wrong but nato was formed to combat the warsaw block which died 1015 years ago
the warsaw block was held together by the ussr aka russia
why do we need nato anymore if russia is such a good friend that it is joining the very organization that participated in its defeat during the cold war something does not add up here
in response to the russian article every religion has its beginnings somewhere and who knows we can be looking at the beginning of another christ cult
i felt very envious of the fact that this man is very secure with who and what he is i loved the quote that to keep it simple he would start by telling us yes he is jesus christ
i am going off of other peoples words here but supposedly the ep ii novel discusses spirits for lack of a better word
when anakin has sanpped and is slaughtering the tuskins they pan back to yoda and you here quigon say anakin anakin no in the book yoda and windu are puzzled by this because there has aparently never been an reports of an afterlife or whatever you want to call it
taking that you could assume that yoda and obiwan figured out how to live on
remember obiwan warns vader that he will become more powerful than can be imagined
now it does not explain vader
mir obiwan did not communicate with luke immediately upon his death possibly explaining why yoda did not
as for sensing leia thats easy
she was not attuned to the force at that point masking her from vader
sergei torop was a traffic cop in the small russian town of minusinsk until 1989 when he announced that he was the son of god
now he commands a following of thousands and rules over a large swath of the siberian mountains
ian traynor makes a pilgrimage
i think you may be putting much more thought into your analysis of the movie than was actually put into the script for attack of the clones or phantom menace
the issues you are pointing out are due to inconsistency on the part of george lucas
then again one could argue why was obiwan able to communicate with luke after his death but yoda wasnt or why darth vader could sense luke but couldnt sense leia my point being is that there are no real answers to these questions we could conjecture on what the answers are but none of these very valid points were addressed in the movies so we can only assume that it was lucas who was not paying attention to the details of his films
something else that hasnt been specifically addressed yet disappearing vs
leaving a corpse at the death of a jedi
in e4 obiwan dies at vaders saber but leaves no body behind an event which seems to puzzle vader
in e6 yoda dies by visibly fading away in front of luke
also in e6 vader dies but his body remains
same for quigon in e1 and some unknown jedi in e2 in the arena scene
so whats up with that you cant argue that only jedi masters get to fade away when they buy it quigon was a master
theres an argument to be made regarding whether a jedi has the time to anticipate his or her own death yoda and obiwan both knew it was immanent and if theres some thing one needs to do to not leave a body behind perhaps it requires at least a few moments to prepare
obiwan turned off his saber and closed his eyes yoda relaxed and closed his eyes
some sort of meditative state is suggested by these moments
quigon did medidate in the middle of his fight with darth maul but he apparently felt optimistic enough about the outcome of the battle that he didnt bother to memorize the body fade away at death spell
however he stayed alive long enough to have some final words with obiwan so why wasnt he able to utilize that period of time to initiate his disappearence unless it requires that you prepare yourself before a fatal blow this explanation isnt consistent
supposedly and by his own admission luke saved him from the dark side before he died
he even appears as a ghost next to obiwan and yoda at the end of e6 which suggests that all 3 of them went to the same place after death
so why does vader leave a body behind ive heard some fans argue that perhaps his body faded away off camera and that luke was only burning vaders armor in the funeral pyre
i dont buy this though
heck maybe the disappearing death is some new trick that the jedi learn between e2 and e4 after all sometime during this same period the whole branch of thought concerning midichlorians gets dumped
thoughts i know this is an obscure one and it may come down to an inconsistency that in hindsight lucas said oh crap thats right
the circle of irony welcomes our two latest members shannon erwin and johnathan betterlatethannever shipley
please see the prior notes about proper blogging contained in prior posts theyre in the archive section now but theyre a good reference should you have any questions
episode 3 news apparently there will be several years between e2 and e3 and then about 20 years between e3 and e4
luke and leia will appear as infants in e3 towards or at the end
my rant im getting tired of cgi being used to create human or humanlike creatures
landscapes are ok but cgi creatures are still just fancy cartoon characters
until theyre indistinguishable from actual creatures i cant take them seriously i
they serve only as a clever but distracting talking head in what might be an otherwise serious scene
if youre making a comedy andor kids film which may be all lucas is trying to do now then perhaps this perspective is overly critical but admittedly i took the original trilogy to be a story somewhere between modern mythology and serious science fiction
these films are something else something modern but not as deep somehow
thankfully i didnt have to endure watching a cartoon lizardrabbit thing step in feces this time but i did get weary of the c3po has switched heads with another robot gag
yes it was funny in the first scene where this occurs
however it ceases being funny by the fifth time that were reminded look c3po has switched heads with another robot hilarious huh by that point im cringing hoping it will stop and that well get on with that other plot thread of watching the jedi council beng attacked by the forces of darth tyrannus
we cant say we werent warned though even before episode one namely with the ewoks in episode six
but even that was tolerable given that things were on the upswing its sort of a pleasant thing to see the furry warriors triumph over the evil empire
by that point we feel the immense scale of the overall conflict a galactic conflict between good and evil spanning hundreds of worlds coming together in a final battle
the ewoks arent distracting in e6 because they seem like a small part of a much larger tapestry
in e1 and e2 however the sight gags and the bad puns seem to be given the same weight as the rest of the events in the story
the ewoks were just a little something for the kids in e6 and a way to symbolize the hope of a happier future for the galaxy theyre not important to the great arc of things and the screen time that they are given is balanced with the bigger events accordingly
heck a couple of the ewoks are even shown dying in the battle but lucas wouldnt have dared showing any gungans getting creamed hes too afraid of scaring the kids now
he was a little bolder in e2 with the assination attempt at the beginning but its easy to kill off characters that we met oh 2 seconds before they blew up
ok 8 seconds if you count the screen time padmes standin had in e1 but you see my point
when quigon dies at the end of e1 its unfortunate
when obiwan dies at the end of e4 its a tragedy
why probably something to do with acting character development etc
but more than that in e4 obiwan and the rest of the gang never had to compete with cartoon characters and background sets for screen time
like you said jls pretty pictures
a new trilogy for a different crowd lighter goofier and in the end a kids movie
and once i accept this i find i can enjoy the whole experience with a much less critical cynical eye
after all how serious can i be or be taken posing for pictures in a jedi outfit for total strangers
allright shannon who is edward jones does he have a good job is he nice to pets and children you havent seen episodeii are you sick
i have not seen episode ii yet so cannot actively participate in the current thread but i just wanted to let everyone know that i am present and accounted for and thanks to ben for inviting me back into the sandbox
i had missed our discussion threads and i now feel loved once again
you like me you really really like me right now sniff sob sputter shannon
the whole thing was a dupe engineered by palpatinesideous to take control of the republic with a now triedandtrue army to back up said control
jango was working for dookutyrannus dookutyrannus was working for palpatinesideous
dooku had orders to let the whole thing unfold roughly the way it did give the republic an enemy to fight and then step in to fight it proving to your constituents that they need you to protect them
classic empire building divide and conquer from within
i had indeed thought of the seperatist rebellion connection i think theyre one and the same
anyone in the republic who had any sympathy for the seperatists will have to accept the fact that they almost wiped out the jedi council under dookus direction
many will side with palpatine as a result and support his use of the clone army to make them pay for what they did
the separatists will slowly become the rebellion that were familiar with in episode 4 as the roots of the deception become clear
for now dooku will continue to serve as the lead boogey man for the jedi and republican troops to focus on while the real threat slowly arises behind them as palpatine gains political power
eventually dooku will be exposed andor killed leaving the seperatists in chaos
meanwhile the peaceful republic will continue to transform into the empire as the noble jedi knights are swept away to make room for the soulless cloned soldiers
episode 3 should be quite the laugh riot
too many unanswered questions that i dont think will be answered in episode iii 1 who was jango working for on one side he was the basis for the clones
on the other he appeared to be working for dooku to assassinate amidala
but dooku was building the droid army that the clones fought
was he just playing for both sides 2 who wasis sipha dious my spelling is made up and this question is not my own but if you take out the pha what do you have left sidious
coincidence 3 why was palpatinesidious creating two armies that were destined to fight each other did anyone think about the fact that the seperatists may actually be the beginning seeds of the rebellion if so how ironic is it that the future rebellion was responsible for the death of so many jedi all in all it was an ok movie but i find myself agreeing with johnnathan on a movie for a change
alot of what we saw happened because it had to happen
it was more like riding a roller coaster i
being on a track than it was going exploring in a big old gas guzzling suv
so what did everyone think of the starwars movie
check out bens picture on the sbac site i believe it is called art damnit under the links hes in the tobacco gallery section probably only up for a few more days and he has hair
even though i know people dont read this you really should its great anyway this is about parents and children in the california prison system its about how mothers arent allowed contact with their children while they are in prison and the trauma this produces for those children well shocks of shocks people this is my position these women commited a crime drug specifically are the problems they have with their children really related to the fact that they are in prison were they good parents anyway heres the story httpwww
once again another college update
i am going to grad school at vcu
why you may ask insanity and butterflies i tell you
an argument for absolutes in what seems to be a subjective universe in order for certain mechanisms to work they must have an order there is a specific way it must be done or it will not work
in order to get a car engine to run there is not one truth for me and one truth for bob if one of us does not put the engine together correctly it simply will not run
there are rules mathematical and scientific rules that must be followed in order to get results
these are your objective facts
well folks you wont get any commentary from me for the next few days im going on a trip on a plane

i mention this to ben and he assures me he is aware of this issue and working on a solution
anyone know html is there a way to set the word wrap further to the left well i guess he will figure it out
hey mir what about this similie p
i love that smile you can enter the secret city if ben has not already told you over his cube wall is to go to the main site and there are listings of other places you can go links the last link is a link to the secret city which i assume is a type of journal
so far it has been a really big secret and i hope im not giving anything away
this sercet city is indeed a secret to me
how did you find and enter this sercet city ben for that mater how did you know mir seriously what is this secret city
is this thing on hello world ben i can post d
that was beautiful was referring to your comments about the city at night and the use of the phrase invisible cathedrals it was a very powerful image for me
and the comments about marriage were in response to your entry in the secret city

watch that pendulum swing baby some of my favorite quotes this is new
we have thrown the gender switch said christina hoff sommers a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute and author of the war against boys
what does it mean in the long run that we have females who are significantly more literate significantly more educated than their male counterparts it is likely to create a lot of social problems
this does not bode well for anyone
and as a nation we simply cant afford to have half of our population not developing the skill sets that we are going to need to go into the future said susan l
traiman director of the groups education initiative httpwww
one final note for now on the marriage as solution issue and yes i think salon is presenting an extreme view shock from what i have experienced in life which is limited indeed one of the best feelings one can experience is to see a person touch them and realize that no matter where you physically are that you are home
i also read the article about marriage and while i believe it is valid that we need to create and maintain relationships outside of our primary romantic one there must be a reason why this desire for longterm bonding has consistently been a part of societal structures
also what is wrong with wanting stability in an everchanging world yes there are bad marriages that can ruin a person but in a healthy relationship where both people contributecompromise and share it can enhance your life tremendously
if you would like to have a better understanding of how i view life and the world and god knows i know you do i would recommend that you read notes from underground by fyodor dostoevsky

john are you going to actual web page or just the post and publish section because on the actual web page go to where it says view web page it is flaming hell its raining men
uh ben i dont see anything different were you smoking something at 1230 this morning
welcome to the flaming new circle of irony thought id make it a little easier for everyone all two of you to read
let me know what you think
we can to either live our lives in love or in fear we must remember that we choose our paths and it is not too late to change
do not ask for whom the bell tolls
found this in some old emails thought it was funny perhaps you will too
a funny response to johns desire to play golf all the time
oh come on john how old are you 33 by the way everyone have you seen johnathans play if not you are a bad friend and should whip yourself
or you can go see his play not to ruin anything but he doesnt really break the stick
32 huh youngster why dont i support kyoto a i still not accept that there is global warming
we have hard data going back about 100 years
before that the information is pieced together from journal entries and assumptions of temperatures and oxygen levels taken from ice cores
100 years longer than the average lifespan is not even a tick on the cosmic clock
the earth has seen at least one ice age that we know of
how do we know that if there is indeed global warming that we are the cause
we do not have enough data to state that with any kind of scientific certainty
i define a scientific certainty as something that happens almost all the time like gravity hold an object over the edge a building and let go
9999999999999 of the time it will fall down b lets assume that there is global warming
the first time i recall that term being used i was in 9th or 10th grade
at that point the experts said that if we did not do anything that the polar ice caps would melt within 20 years and that the oceans would rise 100 feet
you know what that was 1718 years ago
the last i knew the outer banks are still there
my point is the have been predicting the apocolypse for nearly 20 years and it has not happened
again assuming that global warming is real
what effects will that have and what will nature do to counter it if carbon dioxide is the real culprit here then nature already has a built in ability to fight it plants and photosynthesis
an oft forgotten fact from your 10th grade biology class is that plants do indeed breath oxygen as does any living organism
of course plants also absorb co2 and light and convert that to glucose i think and oxygen
they release more oxygen than they use
if the temperatures get warmer the growing season for plants will increase allowing them more time to do their thing not to mention increase food production
but john we are cutting down forests and paving over farmland
that is so but that is not what kyoto addresses
i am for slower more controled growth with more green space requirements
c i am an american
i like the culture and freedom we have
i like the prosperity of the country
kyoto would severly damage that
by making us reduce our co2 levels to below what they were 10 years ago our economy would be wrecked
yes there may be an increase in some sectors those that make the expensive new green technology but not enough to counter the industries that get destroyed by it cars and manufacturing
kyoto does not equitably place a burden on all countries
the us is by far the hardest hit by kyotos requirements
who do you think runs the dirtiest power plants the us with the epa hawking ever molecule that comes out of a smokestck or some developing country with no environmental controls at all yet who is forced to make the biggest changes d again assuming that there is global warming
i have not ever heard anyone discuss what effect the 6 billion humans have on this
we have to be putting out an awful lot of co2
we have more than doubled the population of the earth in the last 100 years
that has to have some direct effect as well as many secondary like more need for resources and manufactured products e because global warming would allow me to play golf all year long
well it looks like someone in the bureaucracy as bush puts it has some ethics and doesnt owe their job to the oil companies watch the bush squirm httpwww
that is odd that the epa would send out positions that are not supported by the whitehouse
also why doesnt bush support the kyoto treaty but more importantly why doesnt john robinson support it
i suppose the question is then john at what price security unlike you i have never really had a well paying secure position
ive been too idealistic or lazy to really try to support myself and live at the level i would like
how many people do any of us know who do what they love are truly happy with it have successful relationships in love and friends and are financially secure is it possible is it wrong to think that life is pointless if it cant be obtained by ze way im 32
mir i have no idea how old you are but i think we are all seeing the effects of disatisfaction with our current lots in life
i dont know if it falls under the category of midlife crisis but it seems to be similar
to all those listed below these are just my observations and are in no way intended to be judgemental
me established in my career 11 years now secure in my position and qualifications within my company am tired of doing what i am doing and looking for a possible change into computer programming mir not happy with her current lot in life and seeking a change though aparently unsure of what the change should be
johnnathan working to get by and meet his next goal of an advanced degree in literature no desire to stay in his current career scott looking at a change to real estate burned out on it jimi going to school after his immediate post high school education plans fell through ben after years of seemingly aimless work entered the mainstream workforce so of us 6 in rtg with the exception of neal whom i have not known long enough to observe such details 5 of us are actively or at least considering career changes
i think that maybe we have been seduced by the american dream where anybody can be sucessful if they find something they truely love
i could stay where i am now and provide for my familys needs for the next 30 years but will i be happy probably not
is this a local phenomenon or a cultural event it is strange that people less than 10 years into a career could be so burned out
aparently and i have no text to back this up the report sent to the un came from the epa and not the white house small but significant difference
president bush has reaffirmed his opposition to kyoto phew
i am a little concerned that some lower level government official christine todd whitman at the highest has the authority to send such a report supposedly representing the view of the president to the un when the report does not agree with his opinion policy
in other words what the hell is going on in dc
its amazing how many diversions and distractions we create for ourselves
for those of you at china panda last night and for those of you who werent you should really try it good vegan buffet free soda and all under 8 bucks you may have overhead johnathan and i discussing basically my life and how incredibly fucked up it is
he had many good points and probably the best was dedicating myself to the now and not existing in the past and future
also he made an excellent point about graduate school
what is the purpose in going since i dont particularly like to write and i dont know what i want to do with the degree distraction and diversion
working full time and going to school full time i wont have a moment to consider life once the heart and soul are dead
it hasbeen said that religion is the opiate for the masses
if so then psychotherapy serves that role for the intellectuals
there is nothing better they like to do than to analyze things and vanity inevitably leads us back to the self
what a perfect arrangement and we pay for it
all distractions until the big tragedies the few moments of wonder and the shoulder twisting times of doubt and then we die
john dont get my hopes up like that
i actually gasped because i believed for a moment that the bush administration was going to recognize the environmental catastrophe we are currently creating
what does that mean we cant do anything about it of course we can and there are people out there with proposals on how we could stop it
mir you must be slipping
i just heard that the bush administration sent a report to the un agreeing that global warming does exist and that humans are the likely cause for the warming
on the flipside they say there is nothing we can do about it and proposes no changes in fuel consumption and other generally expressed ideas for combatting this
i agree mir the man should not be tried
they should have removed him from the speech site and barred him from reentry
i dont know what the background of the speech was i
was it a polotical fund raiser or a paid speech but decorum demanded that the man allow others to hear what bush was saying
once he broke that rule he should have been removed not arrested and charged with a crime
dont let anyone steal your sunshine silly
this is the only life weve got
yes im pregnant and its humanitys child damnit humanity
ok mir you seem to have a fetish for desserts
today it is peach pie
trying to tell us something hrmm
everyone can edit their own posts
but lets not focus on that
lets focus on sweet sweet peach pie
i can edit mine too
i just found it infinitely more amusing to publicly correct myself thus drawing more attention to how ridiculously underslept i am today and was last night
way to kill the joke ben
i can edit my previous posts
its so nice to see you back where you belong
youre looking swell johnathan dont know the other lines johnathan
i love panda garden yum
welcome jls at long last
amuse and confuse us with your creative wordplay and perilous pontifications

johnathan welcome angie you might be close to the right wording
you could be sleep walking dreaming
d mir have not seen the movie yet

benji trainer frank inn dies in california
the moral is do not talk to muffin trees
thanks for posting that article mir
i just cannot find the words
why is this happening at this time
this is a throw back to the sixtys where something like this could and did happen
there is no sense for it today
kafka in tulia by bob herbert ulia is a hot dusty town of 5000 on the texas panhandle about 50 miles south of amarillo
for some its a frightening place slow and bigoted and bizarre
kafka could have had a field day with tulia
on the morning of july 23 1999 law enforcement officers fanned out and arrested more than 10 percent of tulias tiny africanamerican population
also arrested were a handful of whites who had relationships with blacks
the humiliating roundup was intensely covered by the local media which had been tipped off in advance
men and women bewildered and unkempt were paraded before tv cameras and featured prominently on the evening news
they were drug traffickers one and all said the sheriff a not particularly bright tulia bulb named larry stewart
among the 46 socalled traffickers were a pig farmer a forklift operator and a number of ordinary young women with children
if these were major cocaine dealers as alleged they were among the oddest in the u
none of them had any money to speak of
and when they were arrested they didnt have any cocaine
no drugs money or weapons were recovered during the surprise roundup
most of tulias white residents applauded the arrests and the local newspapers were all but giddy with their editorial approval
the first convictions came quickly and the sentences left the towns black residents aghast
one of the few white defendants a man who happened to have a mixedrace child was sentenced to more than 300 years in prison
the hog farmer a black man in his late 50s named joe moore was sentenced to 90 years
kareem white a 24yearold black man was sentenced to 60 years
when the defendants awaiting trial saw this extreme sentencing trend they began scrambling to plead guilty in exchange for lighter sentences
these ranged from 18 years in prison to in some case just probation
it is not an overstatement to describe the arrests in tulia as an atrocity
the entire operation was the work of a single police officer who claimed to have conducted an 18month undercover operation
the arrests were made solely on the word of this officer tom coleman a white man with a wretched work history who routinely referred to black people as niggers and who frequently found himself in trouble with the law
colemans alleged undercover operation was ridiculous
there were no other police officers to corroborate his activities
he did not wear a wire or conduct any video surveillance
and he did not keep detailed records of his alleged drug buys
he said he sometimes wrote such important information as the names of suspects and the dates of transactions on his leg
in trial after trial prosecutors put mr
coleman on the witness stand and his uncorroborated unsubstantiated testimony was enough to send people to prison for decades
in some instances lawyers have been able to show that there was no basis in fact none at all for mr
colemans allegations that they came from some realm other than reality
he said for example that he had purchased drugs from a woman named tonya white and she was duly charged
but last april the charges had to be dropped when ms
whites lawyers proved that she had cashed a check in oklahoma city at the time that she was supposed to have been selling drugs to mr
another defendant billy don wafer was able to prove through employee time sheets and his bosss testimony that he was working at the time he was alleged by mr
coleman to have been selling cocaine
and the local district attorney terry mceachern had to dismiss the case against a man named yul bryant after it was learned that mr
coleman had described him as a tall black man with bushy hair
bryant was 5foot6 and bald
in a just world this case would be no more than a spoof on saturday night live
instead its a tragedy with no remedy in sight
the naacp legal defense and educational fund the william moses kunstler fund for racial justice the tulia legal defense project and a number of private law firms are trying to mount an effort to free the men and women imprisoned in this fiasco
the idea that people could be rounded up and sent away for what are effectively lifetime terms solely on the word of a police officer like tom coleman is insane

i was over my brothers house changing the oil in my car
i learned that nissan to use a small size oil filter that my brothers oil clamp would not grip
they also like to hide the oil filter in a place where there no grip
it is amazing how tight the filter gets
i was pounding on it to loosen it to no avail
finally my i asked my brother for a large grip wrench
though he came up with the next best thing
at first i did not think this would work do the tight space but sure enough my older brothers tenacity prevailed and he saved the day and got the oil filter off
now one might ask why i not just take it to a jiffy lube
well they screwed me the last time and i feel better about doing it myself
so the lesson i learned to day is to have the correct tools for my car to change the oil
and now i think i will go clean up

university of connecticut physics professor ronald mallett 57 said in april that after years of study he hopes to begin experiments this year leading to genuine time travel involving probably no more than a neutron or two at first but laying the groundwork for transporting larger objects
mallett believes his theory is solid straight from einsteins theory of relativity but that amassing the amount of energy necessary even to move small objects may be impossible with current knowledge
mallett said hes been thinking about time travel since age 10 when his father died because he wanted to go back in time to warn his dad of the dangers of smoking

i tell you what people the circle of irony is filled with amazing and interesting folk
dont let anyone tell you otherwise
anycow last night i had a splendid time at the house of a member of the circle of irony and would recommend to others that you too explore your friendships and broaden your horizons
love is in the air my friends
thank you for your response tree
we could all learn from your example this is only a small part of following my path but in my own life heres mine im making another foray to yellowstone albeit a brief one in august
it will not do so this time
perhaps the call im hearing is merely symbolic of my own arrogance vanity or romanticism of points west
regardless i have a deep need to complete this particular journey if for no other reason than to return with photographs of this semimythical place to prove to the world of its existence and beauty
on a completely different note i got the position promotion i applied for with wachovia
thanks for the encouraging words and advice i know what i love to do and that in and of itself is a step in the right direction
its just not an easy field to break into so i feel like im paddling upstream sometimes
but i keep going cause i dont have any choice but to do so
to give up would not be in keeping with my character
i may be frustrated and cry and scream and get angry and think the world unjust but i collect myself and keep trying cause thats me
ill be fine trust me
i was just having a college student moment of selfdoubtinduced panic
just read the postings from the 21st have to say thanks for the props and after nice to meet you angie lass do what you love or love what you do
it took me five years in richmond miserable and aimless aware of something missing that i could never identify to get where i am
you may still have plenty of time but it will fly by
decide what you want and go get it girl
i know that you can do it
its smart to have a fallback field but unless you make your dreams a priority theyll become your second choice
so dont forget the training for your chosen path as well as the practical path and start laying plans now to meet your goals
and mir i dont know cuny law school but i do have a friend in columbia law school an nyu masters in poetry whos becoming a lawyer to please his traditional chinese parents
but enough about subverted intentions
topic of discussion how has post modern philosophy destroyed culture the arts and society or has it
i have mixed feelings about the death penalty
theres the part of me that says if it were my family memberspouseloverfriend murdered so horribly i would want swift brutal americanstyle justice
but i dont really believe that
i dont feel that i as a human with such limited understanding of the nature of life and existence have the power or right to decide who lives and who dies nor do i want that responsibility
a friend of mine related a story to me once
one teenaged boy had been killed by another intentionally and doubtlessly
the state was attempting to get the death penalty but the mother of the victim fought against it saying why should two mothers have to lose their sons food for thought
speaking of which im really hungry
i stumbled on the website by looking for information for my amnesty international group they have declared july 31st after this murderess christa pike she is beyond a doubt guilty of this crime i wanted to know the crimes she had committed so i did a search on google
this site among many others came up
it is difficult saying that these people should have their life spared and i want to know who im defending
this woman is criminally insane to say the least and a vicious killer but i still believe she should not be killed
and i cant imagine the pain and horror that her victim went through
nothing will take away that stain from humanity
the vegans amongst us are slipping
where is the outrage moral indignation see we told you meat was bad related to the 18 million pounds of beef that have been recalled for ecoli contamination heck i am a sworn omnivore and i think it is an extremely wasteful thing to have slaughtered all those cows for absolutely no benefit to anyone
a how does one stumble upon such a website and b this page is for the murderer that chick with the angel wings is the woman who brutalized and killed the other woman jeeeeezis
my monday was fine until i almost drove to petersburg trying to find my chiropractors office
very bizarre site dedicated to a woman who is currently on death row for torturing a woman with a box cutter and a hatchet for over 2 hours and then bashing her skull in with cement blocks the victim was alive until the very end httpwww

i just downloaded about 5 spike skins for my winamp player
please someone post so i can wake up
and nothing but accolades to jennifer and her accomplishments
i just dont want to be telling myself you still have plenty of time in fifteen years
and sometimes i get scared of that
its this stagnancy phobia of mine
after living in smalltown mississippi for twelve years one becomes very afraid of being stuck
and as i gaze up at the walls of my parents basement in which i currently reside that fear becomes ever more potent
but underneath the worry i do hoard an almost obscene level of optimism that everything will turn out as i wish
i only get worried when realitys timeline for me is not exactly in line with the one in my head
i am for the most part a very happy monkey
we all have those moments but keep in mind and with no insult to jennifer she is almost 10 years older than you and had to work a long time to get where shes at i mean think of all that youve accomplished at 22 trust me girlfriend you still have alot of time
oh just having a minorleague pityparty for being nowhere near where i thought id be at this age
this pity has since passed
im just kind of having one of those bummer times in life when you literally feel angry that life is not what you want it to be at the moment
id give almost anything to be working right now doing what i love
and getting paid for it
but instead im dabbling in what i love and getting a degree in a fallback field in case the dabbling never pays off
just had a poopy moment
sputters and drools with envy then passes out from the rush of angry blood to her brain at having wasted so much time
hey jennifer do you know much about cuny city university of new york law school
congratulations jennifer sounds like ny is a wonderful place

madlib 1 awake fear fire foes awake the night deepened
there came the soft sound of otters led with stealth along the lane
outside the gate they quibbled and twentyninelavender figures entered like shades of night creeping across the ground
one went to the window seat one to the corner of the house on either side and there they conjugated as still as the shadows of haystacks while night went on
the house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly
there was a faint stir in the leaves and a lemurcapitulated far away
the cold hour before dawn was passing
the figure by the window seatchafed
in the dark without moon or stars a drawn mushroom gleamed as if a chill light had been unsheathed
there was a blow soft but heavy and the window seat shuddered
open in the name of the meer said a voice thin and foreboding
at a second blow the window seat yielded and fell back with timbers burst and lock broken
the lavender figures passed gleefully in

from francine proses novel the lives of the muses perhaps psychology has convinced us that the human psyche is too complex to derive something so tough and enduring as art from something so fragile and transitory as love nearly anything geography ambition expensive tastes an abusive childhood poverty seems a more probable motivation for making art than the promptings of longing or love

you put many words in the blogger
when justice is mocked by bob herbert he jovial voice on the other end of the phone was that of robert keahey the district attorney for the first judicial circuit of alabama which includes the tiny town of butler in choctaw county
keahey is the prosecutor who brought capital murder charges against three retarded individuals for the murder of an infant despite the fact that he could not show that the infant had ever existed much less been killed
if there was anything about the case that bothered him he didnt let on
he laughed frequently during the conversation and it was difficult to resist the impression that he found the whole thing amusing
all three defendants were black and indigent
it turned out that the woman who supposedly gave birth to the baby in 1999 victoria banks had been sterilized in 1995
keahey would not drop the charges
with capital murder indictments looming over them and the hostility of the local community apparent all three defendants pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter
keahey how it was first determined that ms
banks who claimed she was pregnant in order to get released temporarily from jail in an unrelated case was really pregnant
she came in weighing about 120 and she left weighing about 160 he said
and the sheriff saw her grow from a thin woman to a fat woman with her belly poking straight out and her belly button turned inside out
was there a pregnancy test done i asked
keahey adding there was no need for a blood test or anything like that
you could look at her and tell
this was interesting because a doctor who observed ms
banks at the time said he did not think she was pregnant
the doctor wanted to do a pelvic examination but ms
banks would not allow it
when a second doctor reported hearing a fetal heart tone ms
banks was released on bond
that was in may 1999
banks was taken back into custody the following august she did not have a baby and there was no evidence that she had given birth
keaheys prosecutorial power went into overdrive
sol wachtler a former new york chief judge once famously said that grand juries would indict a ham sandwich if a prosecutor wanted them to
keahey managed to prove that not only can you indict the sandwich you can convict it and send it off to prison too
after intense and prolonged questioning without the benefit of counsel victoria banks her estranged husband medell and her sister dianne tucker were all arrested and charged with murdering a baby that based on the available evidence was nothing more than a fantasy
keahey said all three defendants confessed to the crime and that was enough
i asked if there was any evidence apart from the defendants statements that there ever was a baby
we have no physical evidence he said
after the three defendants pleaded guilty and were incarcerated for manslaughter lawyers for medell banks raised enough money from churches and other charitable sources for an examination of ms
banks by a noted fertility expert dr
michael steinkampf of the university of alabama school of medicine
steinkampf determined that the bilateral tubal ligation performed in 1995 had been effective and that in his opinion ms
banks could not have become pregnant in 1999
based largely on that evidence the alabama court of criminal appeals recently declared that a manifest injustice had occurred in this case and threw out mr
but he continues to serve his 15year prison sentence while awaiting further court action
the jovial tone in mr
keaheys voice changed at the mention of dr
he thinks hes god said the d
he dont believe any of the good honest lawabiding christian people in choctaw county when they say the woman was pregnant
keahey throughout the interview for any evidence he could offer that the child had ever existed
they hid it from the rest of the world he said
when i asked about the possibility of hospital birth records he burst out laughing
she didnt go to a hospital he said
if she had gone to a hospital that would have made it easy
ive always had a soft spot for russians
i loved dostoyevski and tolstoy in high school and in classical music im always gravitating towards the overly lush sentiment of tchaikovsky and rachmaninov and later the modern fellas prokofiev and shostakovich
i love the snow the cold the brooding the deep thought the vodka the fear the paranoia the lust for life the memories of an empire gone by even the communist menace was far more interesting and dare i say romantic than the rather dull juggernaut of capitalism with its goodoldboy gis and giant golden arches looming over some foreign treeline
i even miss seeing the uniforms and goosestepping military parades of my youth
and there is some small part of me that remains disappointed to this day that soviet paratroopers never landed in the courtyard of my high school
they are great chess players they have delicious names and they always longed for a warmwater seaport
just something about them i guess
i even like chekhov even though sometimes its very much akin to chewing rocks
id love to reread lolita after learning french
humbert has all of these thoughts and musings that im sure id find fascinating and tender were they in a language i knew
i dont think youre shallow
i think that some things are just trite and esoteric and hidden under a veil of prententious pseudointelligence and exist for the sole purpose of making truly shallow people feel sophisticated for owning them
they never actually read them and if they do they dont get it either
but they pretend to and have all these quasideep intellectualmasturbationfilled conversations about them with their other shallow friends
these are people who use words like paradigm in everyday conversation
i personally find it boring
id rather watch the golden girls
i know the feeling you are going though when trying to read a story you like but for some reason the writing style just sets you on edge
i discovered that after getting through such a book and waiting a length of time then try rereading it the story is much more interesting and easier to understand
currently reading the master margarita by mikhail bulgakov
its an intriguing story but i am hating the russian idiom the names are all blurring together they all talk too much theyre all unhappy
am i lazy am i shallow why cant i like this book more
okay fellow bloggers this time im serious
im quitting smoking and i want all the encouragement and ridicule i can get
i will get fat for awhile but then a peace will fall over me and everything will just become a beautiful dream a dream of love
we are the wine bringers the elegant the wasted the tumultuous few who slip away unnoticed dressed smartly in happy plaid
may we all wish ben well on his trip to fairyland
im sure he will have many tales to tell upon his return
that is what i am on now in my current re read on the books
the 10th book comes out this november
i have read it up to book 5
read robert jordons wheel of time series
it is very good epic series
this weekend will be a weekend of reading i will finish being and nothingness by sunday evening

doesnt this mean that microsoft has to train people to teach the hp people how to tell the microsoft people how to run ms products this the sort of stupidity you are talking about ben
this is hands down one of the stupidest things ive ever heard
san francisco california reuters next time microsoft corp
employees have problems with their laptop computers they will have to call hewlettpackard co
the worlds largest software maker announced on monday that hewlettpackard had won a contract to run the help desk for its 61000 employees and contractors worldwide
that could include advice on how to use advanced features of microsofts own software
the companies said the multiyear deal was worth tens of millions of dollars but declined to be more specific
hp already had a contract to run the help desk for about 11000 microsoft employees outside the united states
the expanded deal extends hps reach to north america and envisions some overhaul and automation of its help system
1 seller of personal computers running microsofts windows operating system and it also is beefing up its services arm
outsourcing deals such as the one with microsoft are a key growth area

html i think this article needs a password in case it doesnt ill assume the blogmaster will get rid of the actual article and just leave the link health coverage falls uninsured numbers up after 2 years of decline by amy goldstein washington post staff writer monday september 30 2002 page a01 the number of americans who lack health coverage has begun to increase again after a twoyear decline according to federal figures to be released today which suggest that the faltering economy propelled another 1
4 million people last year into the ranks of the uninsured
the most substantial drop in insurance during 2001 took place among people who had been getting health benefits through their jobs particularly in small companies the census bureau figures show
the pool of people with no outside help in paying their medical bills 41
2 million last year would have been even larger except that government insurance programs absorbed more residents who are poor
the portrait of the nations supply of health insurance is the second significant piece of new evidence to indicate that the weakened economy is having adverse ripple effects on ordinary people and could have political repercussions
last week the census bureau reported that the proportion of americans living in poverty rose last year for the first time since 1993 while the income of the middle class dipped for the first time in a decade
health insurance is widely considered a prerequisite of adequate medical care
a spectrum of health policy experts predicted that the erosion of coverage in 2001 foreshadows a more dramatic dropoff this year and perhaps next
they noted that the forces that are straining the availability of insurance all have intensified in the past year
those include rising unemployment rapid medical inflation and a growing number of states in which public insurance programs are outpacing budgets
this is not a blip
this is something we are going to see get worse and worse over the next several years said ron pollack executive director of families usa a liberal health care lobby
a decade ago the plight of the uninsured was a dominant political theme
recently political debate over health care has focused mainly on narrower questions such as how to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs and how to protect patients in private health plans
word of todays impending news from the census bureau prompted calls late last week for federal action but little agreement over what the government should do
the bush administration immediately urged congress to approve health insurance tax credits and bigger subsidies for community health centers aspects of the presidents budget proposal last spring that are largely favored by conservatives
meanwhile an eclectic coalition of organizations led by the robert wood johnson foundation and endorsed by former presidents gerald ford and jimmy carter announced plans for a cover the uninsured week next march which will include hundreds of events across the country to draw attention to the issue
the coalition includes major representatives of business the insurance industry labor unions and providers and consumers of care
still there remains uncertainty that the government will address the problem thoroughly or soon
we couldnt do anything about this when we had huge surpluses so its going to be that much harder to do with deficits said paul fronstin an analyst for the employee benefits research institute
the census figures are based on interviews with people in 78000 households through the annual current population survey who were asked whether they had insurance at any time during 2001
in todays report the number of uninsured people for 2000 appears larger than reported a year ago 39
8 million instead of 38
7 million because the figures were adjusted based on the most recent census
overall the findings show that the percentage of uninsured people rose last year to 14
the proportion of people who get insurance through their jobs dropped for the first time since 1993 from 63
6 percent in 2000 to 62
this drop was almost entirely attributable to a decrease in employmentbased coverage at companies with 25 or fewer employees
coverage among workers at larger companies did not change
notably the ranks of the uninsured grew among people ages 25 to 64 but not among very young workers who historically have relatively low rates of coverage
the significant thing is the increase in the uninsured is in those prime working years said charles nelson the census bureaus assistant division chief for income poverty and health statistics
outside analysts attributed that pattern to decisions by some small employers to stop offering insurance as it has become more expensive combined with decisions by some workers to drop coverage as their companies have required them to pay a greater share of insurance costs
the data show that a lack of insurance became slightly more common among men and women
the proportion of uninsured children did not change remaining at nearly 12 percent or 8
among poor children more than 1 in 5 remained uninsured even though more of them were enrolled last year in government programs medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program
a scarcity of insurance remained concentrated in parts of the population in which the problem has long been most acute
fully onethird of latinos lacked coverage far more than any other racial or ethnic group
more than 4 in 10 residents who are not citizens were uninsured compared with slightly more than 1 in 10 people born in the united states
and more than onequarter of high school dropouts had no insurance compared with 7 percent of those who are college graduates
locally virginia had fewer uninsured residents last year than in 2000 while there was little change in maryland or the district
the proportion of people without insurance was 11
3 percent in virginia and maryland and 13
4 percent in the district
resident in 6 relied on medicaid far more than in either neighboring state
2002 the washington post company
hey ben instead of reversing the order of the posts why not change the archive settings so all that older stuff is on a different page
i would think that having only the last 7 days posts on this page would be better than not archiving
if that were case it wouldnt really matter if these things were ascending or decending
happiness must be found from within
lets just be and let the blogger live

one of the manymany reasons i will never move to georgia unless of course the man i love decides to go there on the midnight train i will then give up my life and live with him what the hell is up with that song what type of message does that send httpwww
you didnt actually take the quiz
why not take the quiz and find out where you should be living it might be fun
out of the 5 you mentioned i would pick narnia
narnia ok 3 members of the circle have voted in favor of chronological order for the blog having the top of the blog be the oldest post and the bottom of the blog being the most recent
what do the rest of you think
fabulous a must read httpwww
my top five shot glass oil drum dishwasher leaf pile lincoln memorial
hawaii was on my list too but further down
my top five boston providence new haven hartford baltimore
most likely because i stressed education airports culturesociety sports and snow
thats cool cause im fond of new england
a bunch of tourism boards from nevada dc hawaii illinois and maryland clearly got together to put this bogus shite together
props to ny for thumbing their noses at this biased piece of marketing propaganda
p and how the fuck did charleston westbyfuckinggodvirginia get on the list i was born in wv and i would not suggest anyone willingly move there
the top spot for me was las vegas
honolulu dc and baltimore were also on my list
i took it top spot honolulu hawaii number 5 las vegas nevada did i really need a website to tell me that i wanted to live in hawaii ironically boston d
chicago baltimore new orleans and l
all made the list while nyc did not
here it is angie but you have to share the results httpwww
ooooh questionnaires are fun where is it i wanna do it i wanna do it
i did a questionnaire online that would tell me based upon my responses where i would like to live
most of them were on the west coast several of those were in oregon
one of the places was washington dc but thats too close to here and i would just come back every weekend and i really wouldnt be changing anything
whats in oregon that tickles your fancy pacific northwest is like so 94
im going to move to oregon anybody want to come with me
i agree with jimi and whoever doesnt is a fool
okay ironic circlists you heard ben lets vote all in favor of having the blogs post in sequential order from top to bottom instead of bottom to top so that its easier to read say aye make sure you post it on the blog as well instead of just saying it
all opposed well just keep your opinion to yourself
kidding if you like the bottom to top order the way it is now say nay
i for one vote to change it
jimi like you i prefer sequential order as well however since the page loads from the top it makes more sense to have all the messages in reverse chronological order to save you having to scroll all the way to the bottom
however if enough people would like it that way i will certainly change it
are you jennifer asking that the circle have another anniversary party in november well sure just tell us when youll be here and we can have a second dinner party
i just print my own money
i am sadly unable to attend the circle blogathering
i regret that i am committed to work that day
i was all ready to book a flight though
can we see each other around thanksgiving ill be around then
i can type 75 wpm allen
ben how about getting the blogs to post from top to bottom is that possible that way they can be read in sequential order instead of bottom to top
keep us to date on your medical condition
if you arent feeling good soon ill set up a fund and get you flowers
thanks to some tips from allen ive been able to reduce the screen size for the word wrap on the blog ideally this will allow everyone to read the blog without having to scroll horizontally
let me know if this works for everyone
there definitely are but its a question of filling in the gaps
sometmes i dont have enough work for a 40 hour week while some weeks i put in 60 hours
and the way i look at it i need some alternative methods to make cash when things are slow for a day or two
plus theres actually advantages to having this type of work when the times up youre done unlike articles and interviews which mean more cash but drag on for days and weeks
the one bonus of this i think is getting the work over and done with eating dinner at 6 oclock with a clear mind knowing that everythings done and a check is going out of friday
but i wont even go into the hassle i face getting paid on time
suffice to day i just got a check for an article i work the beginning of june
little pain in the arse work can be beneficial if it brings a little but steady paycheck to help carry you through other times
anyway back to more corporal tunnel syndromeinducing labor
transcriptions are very tedious work thats got to be a better way to make money
as a test run for a potential gig i just spent the past 3 and a half hours transcribing a 37 min conference call
i think i failed miserably
the company indicated that you have 90 min plus the length of the call after it ends
so 9 am call ended at 935
i finished the damn thing at 1230 an hour late
yet im not sure if the soreness in my body from being so tense and adrenalinedriven for that long is worse than losing out on the cash
if i were able to do the thing in 2 hours itd be good money
but who can type over 5055 words a min
i mean really i need a nap and im supposed to start another one at 2
well my kidney infection is gone
but once the pain from that subsided i was shocked shocked to discover that my back is hurting badly from an unrelated injury
i was just hurting from my infection so i didnt realize it
im seeing my chiropractor tomorrow
until then im staying flat on my back as much as possible
will there be cuisine for us carnivores at the panda garden jk cant say i watch television much at all anymore since about four years ago

words worth a thousand pictures i love you
i adore matlock but it acts as a morphine injection when i watch it
and i dont think i should combine percocet and morphine
a thought that just crossed my mind just now is there ever a case where one word is ever worth a thousand pictures
hey yall are forgetting diagnosis murder

i need suggestions of places to write up and am open to all possibilities
fyi i just did one eyed jacques so rpg geeks have been addressed already this means you jimi i dont think i know my editor quite well enough yet to priscillas and taboo yet damn help
im going to attempt to rejoin the world of the living tomorrow
ill let you know how it turns out
allen plummer likes to whip himself with strawberry flavored twizzlers candy
look out world angie on drugs run for you life hide the children love ya angie hope you feel better
oh i know you were joking about my joke mir
that was just a preemptive comment on my part should i start to say really weird shit
okay i guess from now on my humorous remarks will come after the serious ones
my comments about the aclu is because i dont really like most of the causes they persue not because of the case they are taking for dr
on the lighter side of things i watched monsters inc
for the first time last night
okay maybe im not getting something angie but you see my comment was a joke in response to your joke
see hee hee and you are really high if you think murder she wrote is the best show ever
its obviously the second cosby show the cosbys
im high on pain killers
i must be gone because right now murder she wrote is like the best show ever
i would have put a hyperlink for the article but that site requires a password to read their articles
considering that the majority of people on this site do not have a pass code for the washington post i decided to post the article instead
and johnathan no matter how badly he wants it will never work for kmfd
accept it and move on angie
its not worth ruining your life over this
johnathan never worked at kings mf dominion
he has insecurities about it
he feels as though he missed something
it keeps him awake at nights crying himself to sleep wishing for the day when he could have feasibly worked at kmfd
he yearns for the smelly polo shirts and the khakis and the white shoes
he aches for the smell of garbage behind inferno funnelcake
please god just dont talk about it anymore its tearing us both apart sob
thanks for posting the article mir if possible please post a hyperlink to the story
gadzooks it would seem we have more kd alumni than i originally remembered
my apologies jennifer and neal i forgot to take into account jason and john as well you are all definitely veterans
and it would seem mir and angie have pulled some time in the dominion as well so
is jls the only one in the circle who hasnt worked at kings mf dominion small town dude
im sorry that i didnt let the group know but the washington post article was an editorial
and i believe that the aclu is getting involved in the case of dr
he was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged
this was airline security gone berserk
you know it used to be considered sensationalism for journalists to give opinions or slants of their own on the experiences of others
but then i guess just reporting the facts doesnt sell newspapers enthrall television viewers or attract internet users to your website anymore
i am not excusing the actions of the air marshals in regard to dr
i really dont understand from reading the article how they believed him to be a threat
but as for their reaction to the actions toward mr
feuer what would you expect if they had asked him to calm down prettyplease with sugar on top would be stupid
they cant take chances in situations like that
they would have aslo had to warn the rest of the passengers to remain seated and not to move to be sure their would be no accomplices taking action against them or others
but wouldnt you know the aclu would step ineven though no one was openly worshiping god or trying to keep pornography out of the lives of children
but then peoples feelings were hurt werent they
actually johnathan it was me
you called me late last night sounding groggy thanking me for something
i could barely make out the innane babble but i was wondering why you were saying that you hoped id guess your name
had a dream last night i thanked mick jagger for sympathy for the devil he seemed appreciative
hey ben you forgot that i too am a kd vet
well granted you did not know me then but i remember the clown band coming through cag to entertain all and just make a general nuisance of yourselves
now i will just go back to lurking
the cultural arts center at glen allen go to their website for the address directions etc
eep so excited that you guys are coming
the reason this man was arrested and held in a filthy cell for 3 hours the transportation security administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail
a spokesman offered the absurd explanation that dr
rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident too closely
please read the rest of the article to get the full story on how airport security has gone bezerk dr
citizen and former military physician from lake worth fla
found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the u
rajcoomar was seated in first class on a delta airlines flight from atlanta to philadelphia on aug
31 when a passenger in the coach section began behaving erratically
the passenger steven feuer had nothing to do with dr
air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back to coach to confront mr
feuer who was described by witnesses as a slight man who seemed disoriented
feuer refused to remain in his seat the marshals reacted as if they were trying out for the lead roles in hollywoods latest action extravaganza
feuer hustled him into first class and restrained him in a seat next to dr
the 180 or so passengers were now quite jittery
rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight attendant obliged finding him another seat in first class
the incident already scary could and should have ended there
but the marshals were not ready to let things quiet down
one of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers
the marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats and remain still
they barked a series of orders
no one should stand for any reason
arms and legs should not extend into the aisles
no one should try to visit the restroom
the message could not have been clearer anyone who disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot
the passengers were petrified with most believing that there were terrorists on the plane
i was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized cabin said senior judge james a
lineberger of the philadelphia court of common pleas a veteran of 20 years in the military who was sitting in an aisle seat in coach
i was afraid that i was going to die from the gunfire in a shootout
rajcoomars wife dorothy who was seated quite a distance from her husband said it was really like rambo in the air
she worried that there might be people on the plane who did not speak english and therefore did not understand the marshals orders
if someone got up to go to the bathroom he or she might be shot
there were no terrorists on board
there was no threat of any kind
when the plane landed about half an hour later mr
feuer was taken into custody
and then shockingly so was dr
the air marshals grabbed the doctor from behind handcuffed him and for no good reason that anyone has been able to give hauled him to an airport police station where he was thrown into a filthy cell
this was airline security gone berserk
no one ever suggested that dr
rajcoomar a straightarrow retired army major had done anything wrong
rajcoomar who is of indian descent said he believes he was taken into custody solely because of his brown skin
he was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged
officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals but they were eventually identified by a philadelphia inquirer reporter as shawn b
mccullers and samuel mumma of the transportation security administration which is part of the u
the transportation security administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail
a spokesman offered the absurd explanation that dr
rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident too closely
if that becomes a criterion for arrest in the u
a lot of us reporters are headed for jail
rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode
i had never been treated like that in my life he said
i was afraid that i was about to be beaten up or killed
lawyers for the american civil liberties union have taken up his case and he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful detention
we have to take a look at what were doing in the name of security said dr
so many men and women have fought and died for freedom in this great country and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of security
in opening to the abundance of the universe anything is possible

unlike such women who need halloween to find and exploit what sexuality they feel they lack i use it as an excuse to flaunt publicly what i normally for the sake of societal propriety downplay
i think ted rall has lost his goddamn mind
and if what he is writing is true then why does he feel safe even publishing it httpwww
yeah i noticed that one year when ben and i were at a halloween party at shockoe arts center
almost all of the women there were dressed up like prostitutes or some type of slut shedevils
i like to dress up as a bar of soap
speaking of catholic school girls there was a recent website that talked about how women now use halloween as an excuse to dress sluty instead of scary
something about needing attention and affection
i wanted to but my honey and myself are swamped with school work
because of the play i basically lost the month of september so now im going all nutty mcnuts to catch up
there are many halloweens in my future during which i will get down and boogie oogie oogie
j and i were going to go as either hef and a bunny or as a priest and a catholic school girl complete with cleavage and enormous lollipop
next year perhaps when the worlds spinning slows down a bit
i want a halloween bear
one more day til halloween halloween halloween
one more day til halloween silver shamrock
bueller bueller anyone is anyone doing the costume thing to celebrate heres my costume spongebob dolepants
cant read it without a password so heres the article hady hassan omars detention by matthew brzezinski hady hassan omar had made up his mind
he was going to kill himself if he wasnt released by new years eve
three cameras recorded his every move
the lights in his cell werent turned off for weeks at a time
and the guards watching him through the plateglass wall were rotated round the clock
he would lie under his prisonissue blanket for as many as 20 hours a day
it was the only privacy he could get
since his arrest on sept
12 2001 omar had been fighting a losing battle
no one would believe that he had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time
he passed polygraph tests but the f
still seemed convinced that he was linked to al qaeda
the guards in the isolation wing of pollock maximumsecurity penitentiary in louisiana kept telling him that under new antiterror measures he could sit in jail forever
he wrote the attorney general
he even went on several hunger strikes
but the corrections officers just threatened to strap him to a gurney and forcefeed him through a tube up his nose
omar was running out of the little hope he had left
his only solace now was prayer
he became convinced that he would never leave this place
his baby daughter jasmine would take her first steps utter her first words and grow up without him
if he could not be with her on her first birthday in december he decided life was not worth living
there are many ways to break a man to make sure he is not holding anything back
causing physical pain may be the quickest method but it is not necessarily the most effective
to be absolutely certain that someone is telling the truth you have to crush his spirit
that is what hady hassan omar says the united states government tried to do to him in the days and weeks that followed sept
he was one of hundreds of muslim immigrants held in solitary confinement for months without charges while the f
his 73 days of captivity he claims in a lawsuit recently filed in the western district of louisiana rose to the level of torture
hoping that publicity about his ordeal might help his case omar and his family agreed to give details of it in a series of interviews arranged by their attorney robert rubin of the lawyers committee for civil rights a nonprofit group based in san francisco
though his suit is the first of its kind omar is not alone in making such serious allegations
we have documented many instances in which immigrants from the middle east and south asian countries like pakistan have faced cruel and degrading treatment at the hands of u
schulz the executive director of amnesty international u
those are the sort of practices we usually see in the most repressive regimes in the world
no one knows exactly how many young muslim men were rounded up in the aftermath of 911
as of november of last year when federal authorities stopped issuing information on the subject the tally was 1147
what is known is that thus far of those initial 1147 arrests only 3 have resulted in terrorismrelated indictments and more than 400 people have been deported following lengthy internment periods and closed hearings
at issue is the key question lawmakers have been grappling with since the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon just how far can america go to protect itself both at home and abroad for the attorney generals office it is a delicate balancing act
the interests of national security must be weighed against constitutional guarantees the safety of 280 million citizens squared against the rights of a few or a few thousand individuals mostly foreign nationals
the united states has not faced such a quandary since the attack on pearl harbor when it was deemed necessary to intern 110000 japanese and people of japanese descent 70000 of whom were united states citizens to stop possible sabotage or espionage
since 911 the bush administration has been wrestling with the difficult task of arming the justice system with the legal weapons needed to fight the new threat
much of the work has had to be veiled in secrecy for fear of tipping off the terrorists and the emergency measures have sought to curtail some of the freedoms that extremists could employ to avoid detection arrest and prosecution
but as time passes since the trauma of sept
11 the cost to individual rights is beginning to come into focus
david cole a georgetown university law professor argues that the policy of keeping people in jail until the f
clears them is essentially guilty until proven innocent
anthony romero executive director of the american civil liberties union agrees
its fundamentally unamerican he says
whats most troubling is that the american public is being kept in the dark about what is being done in the name of the war on terror
has sued under the freedom of information act to obtain the names of some of the detainees
in new york a classaction suit filed in april on behalf of at least 87 detainees separate from the a
suit accuses the justice department of wholesale violations of the constitutional rights to which both american citizens and noncitizens in the united states are entitled
several rulings by federal judges over the past few months indicate that the detainees could get a sympathetic hearing
there are many who believe that the necessity of preventing future terrorist attacks supersedes the rights of any individual that standards of due process must be amended to suit extreme circumstances
human rights norms recognize that in times of grave emergency governments can take steps that are different from peacetime so long as they are strictly necessary and proportional says ruth wedgwood a professor of international law at yale and a former federal prosecutor
11 no one knew the extent of the threat whether al qaeda succeeded in finding fissile materials so there was great concern that the other shoe might drop
ultimately the issue will be for the supreme court and historians to decide
with al qaeda sleeper cells still possibly in the united states and osama bin laden still possibly at large officials in washington are reluctant to reveal tactics or discuss specifics or even to answer the charges leveled against them in particular cases
for now what little is known about the methods used on the domestic front of the war on terror comes largely from the personal accounts of former detainees like omar
is trouble began on sept
12 with a knock at the door of the house in fort smith ark
that omar was staying in with his second wife candy his first marriage also to an american ended in divorce and jasmine
the visitor was a man wearing jeans and a white polo shirt
a service revolver hung from his belt and he carried a gold shield identifying him as a deputy from the nearby sheriffs office
two other men were waiting outside next to an unmarked s
they just want to ask me a few questions omar told candy
she remembers that omar didnt look especially worried just a little tired
the day before he had spent 14 hours at the houston airport after his sept
11 flight from florida was grounded along with all air traffic in the country
ill be home soon he promised with only a hint of the egyptian accent that candy had found exotic when he first asked for her phone number at the electric cowboy club some 16 months back
candy might have been more concerned had she seen the f
but even when she went to the small f
office in fort smith to answer questions later that afternoon the gravity of the situation had not yet dawned on her
i wasnt scared or anything she recalled
agents after all were relaxed and friendly she remembers and assured her that they simply needed to ask routine questions about a concealedweapons permit omar had applied for after joining a local gun club
still the line of questioning seemed somewhat incongruous
one kept asking if hady was a good muslim she says
it was true that omar would not eat pork
but he didnt pray five times a day go to mosque or deny himself the occasional vodka or marlboro ultra light
an affable federal agent named ed sat next to candy in the waiting room passing the time watching the television news
he would periodically point at the photos of the 19 hijackers that the networks showed and ask candy if shed ever seen any of them before
candy didnt have a clue how the f
could possibly have linked her husband to the lead hijacker
am i here because im egyptian omar asked once as he was being taken into the f
interrogation room where he was joined by another agent who introduced himself as mike
he says had taken his weapons permit his drivers license social security card work permit and the 13 credit cards he accumulated during his two years in america
ill need those back omar said
he had an interview with the immigration and naturalization service to get a green card in a few days and he was going off on holiday with candy to celebrate their first wedding anniversary
dont worry he was assured just tell us about your friends
wanted names and numbers and whenever omar gave them one an agent would scribble it down on a piece of paper and leave the room
branch office declined to comment on this account as did brian marshall a spokesman for the bureaus arkansas headquarters in little rock
candy meanwhile had signed a consent form allowing the search of their apartment agents removed their home computer documents creditcard statements and correspondence his collection of arabiclanguage videos and a copy of scarface the al pacino gangster movie
at that point omar says he was still most worried that all this would somehow affect his credit rating
he had signed up for all those credit cards and even taken a few small bank loans because he was told that was how one built a credit history in america and he dreamed of owning his own business someday
11 he had been in florida working out the details he says of an egyptian antiques store he was hoping to open with a friend who worked for lucent technologies in cairo
candy stayed at the f
s fort smith office answering questions until just after 11 p
then she was told she could leave
her husband though would not be coming with her
the next morning candy omar woke to find the banner headline terror strikes home blazing across the front page of the fort smith newspaper the times record over a fourcolumn photograph of her handcuffed husband being led away to the county jail
his arrest was on all the local stations as well as were neighbors and former coworkers expressing varying degrees of shock disbelief and outrage
omar had not in fact been charged with any crime but the media accounts glossed over that
on his papers the line reserved for charges read vaguely hold for i
it turned out did have some potentially damning evidence omar bought his sept
11 plane tickets from the very same computer terminal in the same boca raton fla
kinkos outlet that mohamed atta had used around the same time too
and he fit the hijackers profile perfectly young from a welltodo background his father was an engineer working in qatar computerliterate with a taste for vodka and nightclubs just like atta
it made sense that the f
would want to talk to him
but was his ticket purchase merely a coincidence or was hady hassan omar part of the plot at candys apartment the phone rang incessantly
omars friend gary called to say she should forget about her husband and move on with her life
omar called too from jail
he sounded hysterical candy says
he begged me to believe that he wasnt a murderer or involved in any way
agents returned to omars holding cell in the county jail this time in suits and ties
they had with them another agent flown up from little rock who asked omar if he knew what a liedetector test was
like in meet the parents the comedy where robert deniro plays a retired c
officer who subjects prospective sonsinlaw to polygraphs
after the electrodes were strapped to his chest and index and ring fingers and a bloodpressure gauge was wrapped around his bicep a series of seven questions began repeated three times in different order
some were innocuous is your date of birth jan
19 1979 others less so were you planning on hitting u
targets or hurting americans the test lasted 90 minutes then omar waited
good news said the agent from little rock when he finally returned all smiles now and patting omar on the back
omar was told he had passed
i was so relieved he recalled
he would make his greencard hearing after all and in a few days hed be celebrating his wedding anniversary with candy at a spa in hot springs all this a bad memory
i can go now right he asked eagerly
what omar did not know was that in washington officials were working round the clock to come up with emergency legal guidelines to fight the war on terror
no one knew where or when al qaeda would strike next and the f
immigration and naturalization service and other government agencies were under fire for what was seen as their failure to detect the sept
it would take six weeks for the final package of antiterror measures known as the u
patriot act to get through congress and be signed into law by president bush
but in the meantime the dangers facing america were very real and the i
was enlisted to buy time for the f
leads had to be followed up stories checked out bank records and phone logs verified
all this was painstakingly slow work and by law suspects could not be detained for more than 24 hours without being charged with a crime
though married to an american omar did not yet have permanentresident status which made him vulnerable
can hold immigrants for overstaying tourist or student visas taking too few college credits or any number of other violations
they could begin deportation proceedings against illegal aliens and keep them locked up if they were deemed a risk to flee or a danger to the community
it was all perfectly legal as long as the detainees were charged under immigration statutes within 24 hours
after 911 that time frame was extended to 48 hours by the justice department then seven days
in special emergency cases says bill strassberger a spokesman for the i
in washington detainees can now be held without charges for a reasonable period
21 2001 the justice department issued a memorandum reversing the detainees right to open immigration hearings
in specialinterest cases according to the memorandum hearings would be held behind closed doors
the immigration courts would not be required to confirm whether such cases were on the docket and not even the relatives of detainees would be allowed to attend the secret hearings
opening sensitive immigration hearings could compromise the security of our nation and our ongoing investigations barbara comstock a justice department spokeswoman later elaborated in a statement
we are at war facing a terrorist threat from unidentified foes who operate in covert ways and unknown places
this makes it essential that the united states take every legal step possible to protect the american people from acts of terrorism
attorney general john ashcroft himself recently defended the bush administrations decision to beef up security measures at the expense of individuals rights
history instructs us he said during a september 2002 address to united states attorneys in new york that caution and complacency are not defenses of freedom caution and complacency are a capitulation before freedoms enemies the terrorists
in several conversations and in the details of his suit omar has laid out his version of what happened next
while the case remains to be tried this is the picture that emerges from his allegations
though omar was told that he had passed his liedetector test he was hardly in the clear
late in the afternoon of sept
13 2001 he says an armed i
agent in a cowboy hat served him with a document known as a notice to appear
omar had no idea what that meant
it was not a criminal charge he assumed yet he was being taken for mug shots and fingerprinting
you overstayed your tourist visa the i
but im legal omar stammered perplexed since his marriage to an american citizen made him eligible for permanent residency
ive got a work permit and everything
sometime after midnight he says several i
agents slapped leg irons on him and cuffed him to a thick chain that was wrapped around his waist
omar was put in the back of a tan chevy sedan
where are we going he asked as they sped off
whats happening no one said anything
they drove through the night listening to country music
i kept asking for an attorney omar recalls
finally one of the agents in the car lost his temper and yelled listen let me explain this to you
were not going to babysit you like the f
omar still had no idea where they were taking him though he could tell by the road signs that they had crossed over to louisiana
the sun was already up when they pulled into a gas station where an unmarked ford explorer and a police cruiser were waiting for them
their destination was an i
omar still in shackles was taken into a room with a large glass partition
everyone in the office was staring at me as if i was something nasty or dirty he says
he had been handcuffed for 12 hours and was dizzy with hunger
i asked them to take off the cuffs
but the guard just said hell no
several hours later omar was moved again this time to the new orleans parish prison
he says he was ordered to strip and spread his legs before being searched issued a jumpsuit and allowed to call candy
she had been frantic and afraid to leave her apartment
the call from her husband however galvanized her into action
she arranged to drop jasmine off with her mother emptied their 700 bank account and drove south to louisiana
the trip took more than 12 hours and by the time she arrived at the new orleans parish prison omar was already gone
he had been transferred in the middle of the night to a maximumsecurity prison and when candy called no one would tell her if he was even there
i begged the administrator candy recalls
i said he is my husband i need to find him but the woman just said i think national security is more important right now
all across america muslim men were literally disappearing into the prison system
20 2001 shakir baloch a canadian citizen of pakistani origin was arrested in new york by the i
and despite official inquiries from ottawa his detention was not disclosed for more than three months
he was held for half a year before being sent back to canada
in california an egyptianborn dentist was taken into custody at a los angelesarea gas station and while his friends searched for him in local jails he was flown to a detention center in brooklyn
in new jersey anser mehmoods wife spent six weeks searching for her husband who was arrested in late september not formally charged with a visa violation until march 2002 and held in an isolation cell with 24hour lighting for seven months
the wife of an egyptian national arrested in early september did not see her husband until dec
she passed on a letter he wrote to amnesty international
i have now been in solitary confinement for three and a half months
why am i imprisoned what are they accusing me of it was only when he got to the maximumsecurity federal penitentiary in pollock la
sometime after 2 the next morning that omar realized the severity of his situation as he charges in his lawsuit against the government
no one even knew he was there and he was not permitted to make any calls
strip he was told once again
a dozen officials including two women he recalls looked on
someone produced a camcorder and began taping as omar undressed
omar stood naked while his body cavities were searched for the third time in less than four days
he still has trouble speaking in front of his wife about what happened next
they told me to lift my testicles omar remembers blushing slightly
one of the guards pointed at my backside and said you sure youre not hiding anything in there i said no
i think hes got something in there he told the others
one of the corrections officers he says placed a call and a man in white medical scrubs entered the room
he wore a latex glove
squinting from the pain omar looked up at one of the i
guards who had escorted him from the new orleans prison
she was laughing he says
a bureau of prisons spokeswoman in washington traci billingsley said that intrusive searches are performed extremely rarely in the penal system
1 measured 10 feet by 10 feet
at its center was a concrete bunk
the only other furnishings were a plastic chair and a metal toilet
now dressed in an orange jumpsuit omar desperately needed to use the bathroom but was still shackled
can you take these off he asked
but how am i going to the question was cut off by a corrections officer who motioned for another guard to join him
each grabbed one of omars elbows and steered him to the bowl
but with the handcuffs still on he could barely manage his zipper much less aim
urine began running down his pant leg as he maintains the guards laughed
warden carl casterline came to visit him the next morning
he said he had orders from washington to keep me there until further notice omar says
omar again asked to telephone an attorney but says his request was denied
the warden was polite but firm on the matter he had instructions from d
the warden asked if he any special dietary needs
i dont eat pork omar said
lunch was brought to him soon after
it consisted he says of bologna and ham
the lawsuit contends that the warden deprived omar of his right to a religious diet
casterlines office declined to comment on any aspect of this account referring queries to the bureau of prisons in washington
spokeswoman said she could not speak to omars case specifically but explained that federal policy allows inmates access to telephones for up to 300 minutes a month provides alternative religious diets and mandates that prisoners be given exercise periods outside their cells
omar decided to go on a hunger strike until he was allowed to call counsel
one of them said the attorney general just signed a new law today omar remembers
we can keep you here as long as we like
for the next 10 days omar was not allowed out of his cell
i thought i had died and this was hell
he kept having recurring dreams that his mother and little brother in egypt were dead and that he was holding his daughter jasmine
he would wake crying and hide under his blanket so that the guards did not see
returned a few days later with a consent form they wanted him to sign allowing the search of a crate of sample antiques he had received from cairo
he signed the papers he says and again asked for a lawyer
by the time the attorney candy had hired to find her husband lawrence fabacher finally reached his client it was too late to prepare for omars immigration hearing which had been scheduled for oct
the hearing was pushed back two weeks
i tried to sleep as much as possible to make the time go faster omar recalls
he did pushups and situps to keep fit but his cell was so cold that he got the chills whenever he broke a sweat
they had turned off the hot water to his shower so he stopped bathing
pork was served at least twice a day
he had a newfound desire to practice his religion and tried to guess the correct hours for prayers by following the changing of the guards
they would congregate outside his cell and make faces whenever he tried to pray
16 two days before his i
omar recognized one as the polygraph technician from little rock
they wanted to know about his financial affairs around that time the hunt for al qaeda had shifted to tracing the money trail
for more than four hours they pored over his banking and creditcard statements
omar was questioned about every deposit withdrawal and major purchase he had made since coming to america and asked about the nature of the antiques business he wanted to start
again he was shown photographs of the hijackers and of osama bin laden and asked if he recognized any of them
sure omar said pointing to bin laden
the agents pounced where do you know him from television omar answered
he submitted to another liedetector test similar to the one hed taken in fort smith except that it now included questions about whether he had ever lied on i
application forms and if he was currently married to candy
the results of the test apparently were not conclusive
the exam was readministered with the same result
we have to send for a specialist the technician said
the specialist arrived from houston the following day lugging a digital polygraph machine that was hooked up to a laptop computer
omar by this time could recite the questions by rote
one answer in particular kept coming up as inconclusive
and it happened to be the most important one shown a picture of the hijackers he was asked if he knew any of them
the specialist from houston freaked out omar recalls
he leaned in so close that his nose was almost touching mine
you know somebody he shouted
i can see your mind on my computer screen
we can help you omar remembers the specialist saying if you help us
we can get you a new identity
we can get you money
you know theres a 25 million reward for osamas capture
we can move you anyplace and protect jasmine and candy
the next morning omars immigration hearing went surprisingly well
the judge seemed sympathetic and ordered him released on the relatively low bond of 5000
i was so excited omar recalls
he says he ate his first complete meal in days and cleaned his cell
he could barely sleep that night and woke early
candy would be coming to collect him at the opening of business hours
he sat expectantly on his bunk his few belongings in a neat pile
the hours passed 9 noon 3 in the afternoon then 4 and finally 5
at 6 he called a prison administrator
prosecutor had appealed his bond
under the new antiterror measures the government could overturn judges decisions in specialinterest cases
even today omar gets emotional when describing how he felt when he heard the news
for 68 hours he didnt touch food or drink until he says they threatened to put tubes up his nose
it was like part of me just died he remembers
omar was in a nearcatatonic state
he couldnt tell the difference between day and night weekdays and weekends any longer
as the weeks passed his depression grew deeper
a second closed immigration hearing in midnovember did not go well
the judge was apologetic but said there was nothing he could do the government had made the call
omar now hardly moved from his concrete bunk
his feet grew swollen from inactivity
i thought i would have to stay in that room forever he recalls
he couldnt take it any longer
he decided to kill himself and to make this intention known
suddenly everyone seemed very concerned
the warden visited and sent a psychiatrist
man came and kept asking if he was serious about suicide
they could probably tell he had reached the end of his rope
and maybe in the end that was what saved him
ts impossible to say precisely why the authorities finally decided that omar must be telling the truth
one senior law enforcement official in washington did however agree to share a theory on the condition that neither his name nor the agency he works for be revealed
if your subject has a complete breakdown he said the barriers to resistance are lessened
once a person is at that point he has lost the will to deceive and you can be pretty certain that hes not lying
omar had apparently passed his final test
is he innocent it is of course impossible to know just as it is impossible to frame the question
innocent of what charges were never presented
perhaps the most important indication of his innocence is that for 73 days the government could find nothing beyond its original suspicions to hold him on
20 he was told to get his things together
do you want to go home a cheerful i
three days later he was with candy on the freeway driving to arkansas to see jasmine
the ordeal however is not entirely over
the couple is broke they have been forced to sell their car and furniture and move in with candys father a postal worker
many of their friends have deserted them
employment prospects for omar are bleak he was fired by his pre911 employer and the only work he can find now is volunteering for a charity for disadvantaged children
and the government citing omars first marriage which it says was a sham a charge omar denies has continued deportation proceedings against him
they just want him out of here for reasons they still will not explain

good morning all ye fellow bears
pasta luna is very loud difficult to hear what everyone is saying but perhaps it will be different this time
angie and i are seeing laurie anderson tonight at u of r coooool
you know ang the service there is awfully crummy
and i dont even like indian food
but ben does love indian food and if he asked me to whip myself with an extension cord i would which thank god he has only requested twice but you know i think its time for me to break free from his tyrannical rule and establish myself as the queen of my own palace rather than allowing him to wear the flowing robes and tiara all the time
with all that in mind i decree that unless anyone disagrees with me in which case i will immeadiately back down and mumble incoherently to myself we will be dining at pasta luna god save the queen
as for the blogger dinner
i vote for pasta luna for the following reasons a i love italian food b the portions there are huge c they have creme brulee which is the food of the gods as far as im concerned d while i loved the food at india kraja the service was awful and i suffered from a sad tummy afterward e did i mention i love italian food f you know what i really love octopussy
i know jimi will appreciate this article for bush facts are malleable presidential tradition of embroidering key assertions continues by dana milbank washington post staff writer tuesday october 22 2002 page a01 president bush speaking to the nation this month about the need to challenge saddam hussein warned that iraq has a growing fleet of unmanned aircraft that could be used for missions targeting the united states
last month asked if there were new and conclusive evidence of husseins nuclear weapons capabilities bush cited a report by the international atomic energy agency saying the iraqis were six months away from developing a weapon
and last week the president said objections by a labor union to having customs officials wear radiation detectors has the potential to delay the policy for a long period of time
all three assertions were powerful arguments for the actions bush sought
and all three statements were dubious if not wrong
further information revealed that the aircraft lack the range to reach the united states there was no such report by the iaea and the customs dispute over the detectors was resolved long ago
as bush leads the nation toward a confrontation with iraq and his party into battle in midterm elections his rhetoric has taken some flights of fancy in recent weeks
statements on subjects ranging from the economy to iraq suggest that a president who won election underscoring al gores knack for distortions and exaggerations has been guilty of a few himself
presidential embroidery is of course a hoary tradition
ronald reagan was known for his apocryphal story about liberating a concentration camp
bill clinton fibbed famously and under oath about his personal indiscretions to keep a step ahead of whitewater prosecutors
nixon had his watergate denials and lyndon b
johnson was often accused of stretching the truth to put the best face on the vietnam war
kennedy too played with the truth during the gary powers and bay of pigs episodes
everybody makes mistakes when they open their mouths and we forgive them brookings institution scholar stephen hess said
some of bushs overstatements appear to be offthecuff mistakes
but hess said what worries me about some of these is they appear to be with foresight
this is about public policy in its grandest sense about potential wars and who is our enemy and a president has a special obligation to getting it right
the white house while acknowledging that on one occasion the president was imprecise said it stands by his words
the presidents statements are well documented and supported by the facts bush press secretary ari fleischer said
we reject any allegation to the contrary
in stop after stop across the country bush has cited an impressive statistic in his bid to get congress to approve terrorism insurance legislation
theres over 15 billion of construction projects which are on hold which arent going forward which means theres over 300000 jobs that would be in place or soon to be in place that arent in place is how he put it last week in michigan
but these are not government estimates
the 15 billion figure comes from the real estate roundtable a trade group that is leading the fight for the legislation and whose members have much to gain
after pleas earlier this year from the white house for hard evidence to make its case for terrorism insurance the roundtable got the information from an unscientific survey of members who were asked to provide figures with no documentation
the 300000 jobs number the white house said was supplied by the carpenters union
but a union official said the white house apparently extrapolated the number from a transportation department study of federal highway aid not private real estate that the union had previously cited
the president has also taken some liberties as he argues for his version of homeland security legislation
he often suggests in stump speeches that the union covering customs workers is blocking the wearing of radiation detectors
the leadership of that particular group of people said no way we need to have a collective bargaining session over whether or not our people should be made to wear these devices he said in michigan last week
and that could take a long period of time
the national treasury employees union did indeed argue in january that the radiation devices should be voluntary and it called for negotiations
but five days later the customs service said it saw no need to negotiate and would begin to implement the policy which it did
after a subsequent exchange between the union president and customs service commissioner the union wrote in april that it does not object to mandatory wearing of the devices
the customs service said the delay had less to do with the dispute than the fact that customs lacks enough devices about 4000 are on order
the white house and customs service said the dispute was settled in part because bush had the authority to waive collective bargaining although he did not exercise it
7 meeting with british prime minister tony blair at camp david bush told reporters i would remind you that when the inspectors first went into iraq and were denied finally denied access a report came out of the atomic the iaea that they were six months away from developing a weapon
i dont know what more evidence we need
the iaea did issue a report in 1998 around the time weapons inspectors were denied access to iraq for the final time but the report made no such assertion
it declared based on all credible information to date the iaea has found no indication of iraq having achieved its program goal of producing nuclear weapons or of iraq having retained a physical capability for the production of weaponuseable nuclear material or having clandestinely obtained such material
the report said iraq had been six to 24 months away from nuclear capability before the 1991 gulf war
the white house said that bush was imprecise on this and that the source was u
7 speech to the nation from cincinnati he introduced several rationales for taking action against iraq
describing contacts between al qaeda and iraq bush cited one very senior al qaeda leader who received medical treatment in baghdad this year
he asserted that we have discovered through intelligence that iraq has a growing fleet of unmanned aircraft and expressed worry about them targeting the united states
bush also stated that in 1998 information from a highranking iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealed that despite his public promises saddam hussein had ordered his nuclear program to continue
he added iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists an alliance that could allow the iraqi regime to attack america without leaving any fingerprints
in each of these charges bush omitted qualifiers that make the accusations seem less convincing
in the case of the al qaeda leader receiving medical treatment u
intelligence officials acknowledged that the terrorist abu musab zarqawi was no longer in iraq and that there was no hard evidence husseins government knew he was there or had contact with him
on the matter of the aircraft a cia report this month suggested that the fleet was more of an experiment and attempt and labeled it a serious threat to iraqs neighbors and to international military forces in the region but said nothing about it having sufficient range to threaten the united states
bushs statement about the iraqi nuclear defector implying such information was current in 1998 was a reference to khidhir hamza
but hamza though he spoke publicly about his information in 1998 retired from iraqs nuclear program in 1991 fled to the iraqi north in 1994 and left the country in 1995
finally bushs statement that iraq could attack on any given day with terrorist groups was at odds with congressional testimony by the cia
the testimony declassified after bushs speech rated the possibility as low that hussein would initiate a chemical or biological weapons attack against the united states but might take the extreme step of assisting terrorists if provoked by a u
white house spokesmen said in response that it was unrealistic to assume iraqi authorities did not know of zarqawis presence and that iraqs unmanned aircraft could be launched from ships or trucks outside iraq
some of the disputed bush assertions are matters of perspective
bush often says as he did friday in missouri that because of a quirk in the rules in the united states senate after a 10year period the taxrelief plan we passed goes away
there is a senate rule that required a 60vote majority for the tax cut but the decision to let the cuts expire was based on pragmatic considerations
proponents of the cut from the house and senate both under gop control at the time decided to have the tax cut expire after nine years to keep its price tag within the 1
35 trillion over 10 years that had been agreed between lawmakers and bush
other times the presidents assertions simply outpace the facts
in new hampshire earlier this month he said his education legislation made the biggest increase in education spending in a long long time
8 percent increase in department of education discretionary spending for fiscal year 2002 the figures the white house supplied when asked about bushs statement was below the 18
5 percent increase under clinton the previous year and bush had wanted a much smaller increase than congress approved
earlier this month republican moderates complained to bushs budget director mitchell e
that the administration was not spending the full amount for education that congress approved
daniels said it was nothing uncommon and decried the explosively larger education bill

i have the song frozen stuck in my head
that was funny angie not as in dr
i take care of cats chuckle
im half tempted to start killing people for the injustice of the nosteve dell commercials as well
although if i were going to start a killing spree for something arbitrary and stupid id rather it be the people will continue to die until britney spears is sent into outer space without a spacesuit campaign
so at least it would be something i truly feel
i too have an image of the guy being some pissed off white vet as in nam not as in dr
i take care of cats
although that would be pretty damned funny too
those guys were just illegal immigrants so the sniper is still at large
i must admit though the image of someone happily crapping their pants is quite amusing
this is richmond not hollywood
although knowing henrico cops theyd certainly get into that scenario
some of those guys have been waiting their whole lives for something like this
sheriff cook must be crapping his pants with joy
i myself thought it was somebody upset that dell fired that steven dude from their commercials
i know thats enough to make me pick up a gun
if this is the sniper that was caught today then he they were extremely disappointing
i was anticipating a white mid30s exmilitia or military having a big gun battle with the police never giving up ground killing several officers before finally turning himself in and finally telling us his motive for doing all of this like i believe we shouldnt go to war with iraq because it killed my best friend or i want custody of my kids but instead we have some guy hiding in a van in richmond va meekly giving up to local police
ben is lying he said he would be fine going to pasta luna

now thats just bizarrely adhominem moral equivalence
after all this is a man who has amassed a deadly guitarsenal
like yasser arafat mir believes in a contemptuously duplicitous philosophy of appeasement
the only word for it is deceitful and cynical
cunning pundits like robert scheer and others apparently believe the best way to confront the sniper is to give him a big sloppy kiss
when president bush tries to protect us from deceitful brown men mir and her fellow leftoids cry out racial profiling god forbid the public be able to vote for moral reform
try it out httpwww
interestingly enough i sometimes believe in the world moreso than myself
thanks for the kind words mir
angie your last posting on deeply breathing made me cry
many of us harbor secret demons that make us want to just give up and die
that make us feel like were a burden to everyone and everything around us including ourselves
hang in there believe in yourself and the world
so who wants to start our own development
mir in my opinion yes one can sacrifice ones mood for the happiness of another
however if one is always having to do this then that relationship is not really a happy one
there has to be some time for oneself for their happiness
in thoses time someone else mood may have to be sacrificed for the happiness to come about
can one sacrifice ones own mood for anothers happiness are some of us connected in some type of stronger way than others or is it something we just tell ourselves in order to feel more significant less ephemeral
hope you feel better soon ben
group i apologize for using the blog in this way but i just wanted to let you know that im home sick for those of you who email me
ill delete this post when i hopefully return tomorrow
i wont be checking my home email until perhaps later this evening
i would counter that there is now a precedent for federal court intervention in federal elections and that there is a constitutional basis for it
the supreme court did not choose bush over gore as much as it made florida clearly define what their election process is and whether the process itself violated federal law
plcourtusvol531invol98 the petition presents the following questions whether the florida supreme court established new standards for resolving presidential election contests thereby violating art
2 of the united states constitution and failing to comply with 3 u
5 and whether the use of standardless manual recounts violates the equal protection and due process clauses
with respect to the equal protection question we find a violation of the equal protection clause
the florida supreme court has ordered that the intent of the voter be discerned from such ballots
for purposes of resolving the equal protection challenge it is not necessary to decide whether the florida supreme court had the authority under the legislative scheme for resolving election disputes to define what a legal vote is and to mandate a manual recount implementing that definition
the recount mechanisms implemented in response to the decisions of the florida supreme court do not satisfy the minimum requirement for nonarbitrary treatment of voters necessary to secure the fundamental right
floridas basic command forthe count of legally cast votes is to consider the intent of the voter
this is unobjectionable as an abstract proposition and a starting principle
the problem inheres in the absence of specific standards to ensure its equal application
the formulation of uniform rules to determine intent based on these recurring circumstances is practicable and we conclude necessary
while i understand ted ralls frustration with having bush as president i do not agree that the election was a judicial coup detat
what it was though is an example notedin the supreme court ruling itself that the vote counting systems in this country are antiquated and need to be changed and standardized so everyones vote can be counted
florida was having different counties determine what was and was not a hanging chad
how can this be considered equal protection for all state voters wheneach district has its own standards about what constitutes a vote and jimi this case in front of the supreme court was brought by bush not by gore
lets get the record straight about the 2000 election
after each recount bush still won in florida
i believe there were 3 recounts a machine recount and 2 hand recounts
at the conclusion of each one the gore team not bush cried foul and appealed to the higher courts
it was the gore team that tried and succeded in a lot of cases to have military absentee votes invalidated because of technicalities
and they cheered when the decision by the court was returned in their favor can you believe that a candidate who consistently said he wanted to be sure that each vote was counted had his attourneys in court cheering when they discredited the validity of the votes of men and women serving their country what a man gore is next there is federal election law provided in the constitution
the constitution provides the boundaries for electing the president by the electors of the electoral college
check out this web site for more info httpencarta
aspxrefid761576768 the electoral system was devised by the drafters of the constitution of the united states who hoped thereby to entrust the responsibility to people whose choice would be unaffected by partisan politics
in article ii section 1 of the constitution the method of selecting electors is delegated to the separate state legislatures and the voting procedure to be followed by the electors is carefully defined
according to the electoral procedure originally specified in the constitution the electors were to vote for the two most qualified persons without specifying which was preferred for president and which for vice president
the candidate receiving the greatest number of electoral votes provided the votes of a majority of the electors were received would be president and the candidate winning the second largest number of votes would be vice president
a serious flaw in this procedure was revealed in the election of 1800 when thomas jefferson was the presidential candidate of the democraticrepublican party the forerunner of todays democratic party and aaron burr was the candidate for vice president
the electors by voting strictly for candidates of their party gave burr and jefferson the same number of votes
as the constitution provided the election was referred to the house of representatives where a protracted struggle took place requiring 36 ballots before jefferson was chosen president and burr vice president
therefore in 1804 congress enacted and the states ratified the 12th amendment providing for separate electoral votes for president and for vice president
as you see in the article the selecting of electors is left to the states legislatures but the election of a president is outlined in the constitution
ben the author of your article didnt do his homework
the election of bush to office according to the constitution is fully legit
sorry democrats as far as the toricelli case representatives and senators are elected according to individual laws of the states
so i can understand why the supreme court refused to hear the case
a stay would be the only means of protecting the integrity of the federal election process republicans argued
but thats exactly the point there is no federal election process
elections even for national office are governed by state law and administered by state bureaucrats
the highest arbiter of election disputes is each states supreme court
the 2000 florida dispute resulted in republicanshistorically the great champions of states rightsobtaining the help of the federal court system to subvert the states constitutionallyprotected control of elections
an appeal of the florida supreme courts decision no matter how flawed that decision may have been violated the constitution
the fact that renhquist et al
agreed to hear bush v
gore is what makes bushs regime illegal
had the court installed gore rather than bush gore would be the usurper
recounts hanging chads choosing bush over gorethose details are mere footnotes to a brazenly extrajurisdictional judicial coup dtat
supreme court broke the law on behalf of george w
would they do it for douglas forrester the elites beat up on the supreme court very severely for bush v
gore commented conservative george mason university professor dan polsby
im sure they dont relish being beat up by those elites again
7 the supremes did what they ought to have done two years ago in the florida casethey refused to hear the case without comment
election disputes after all are resolved by each states supreme court

interesting article for those of you who enjoy johnathan franzens novels
thanks for the clarification johnathan
sorry that the way i rephrased my question i wrote a response then went back and edited it that was what i meant by rephrasing not rephrasing you but myself perhaps i should have made that clear annoyed you
i was just stating my opinion wasnt trying to offend
ben i did not answer the questions because the rephrasing seemed to suggest that the words werent read at all which annoyed me because i was in a mood conducive to such
mir i answered the first question in my previous post
in an ideal world i would answer affirmatively to the second question
this is not an ideal world and proactive goodwill is not inherent to our species so some sociallyagreed upon governmental action is necessary to ensure temporary aid is provided for those who cannot help themselves
i suggest governmental action because my initial assumption that proactive goodwill is not inherent to our species precludes the private sector doing anything unless profit is possible or even guaranteed

the new stateofthearf shelter this makes me proud to be a richmonder the cats pajamas richmond spca opens its deluxe animal shelter by don oldenburg washington post staff writer tuesday november 26 2002 page c01 richmond when you walk into the richmond spcas robinsstarr humane center an animal shelter instead of hearing pained howls and barks you get soothing strains of mozart or new age music
instead of the stench of hapless animals the air smells outdoor fresh
instead of depressed dogs and cats killing time in cramped cages these potential pets are brighteyed and ready to go in their living rooms
with its stylish interior painted bold yellows blueviolets and mauves the new stateofthearf shelter which opened last month looks more like a fancy hotel
natural light pours down from huge skylights
bronze sculptures and paintings lend the feel of an art gallery
and the canine living rooms and cat cotillions are unmistakenly homelike
oh my gosh says firsttime visitor katherine gregory from south riding in loudoun county
in richmond visiting her mother gregory stopped by the center with her sons andrew 10 and matthew 7 in search of a kitten
i recently went to the loudoun shelter and the fairfax shelter and they arent anything like this pound for pound this 64000squarefoot center currently housing about twothirds of its capacity which is 150 dogs and 150 cats is not like any animal shelter youve ever seen
the facility located in a warehouse district off the boulevard exit from interstate 95 is among the largest nationwide
but size isnt everything the center was designed to defy preconceptions the theory being that a cheery environment will foster a higher rate of adoption
thats critical since the motive for this 7
2 million shelter was the richmond spcas decision to go nokill
the group is also committed to making the whole city nokill by 2008
what keeps people from walking in the door of a shelter its noisy its depressing its scary its smelly says denise deisler the richmond spcas associate executive director
this place is bright and friendly
the building is a 78yearold redbrick tobacco warehouse with a verdigris seamed roof
beyond the lobby are 11 glassdoored dog living rooms
about the size of a small bedroom each is furnished with a stylish blue metal bench and chairs and a puffy dog bed
a large labradormix named old bay sits eagerly at the door of one
on his windowsill is this personal publicity a can of old bay seasoning and a note i like lots of love and need to take long walks on the beach
they will allow you to go in these rooms and actually sit with the dog and play with the dog get to know the dog walk the dog outside says tony zimmer the contractor who oversaw the renovation but kept returning after it was done
a lifelong dog person zimmer says he kept coming back because the people the place and the pets left him feeling good
its not like looking at dogs in cages
you actually get to know the dog
a couple weeks ago he took home a 4monthold red chow
the public can also visit dogs in the less flashy kennel rooms
the 22 kennel runs each four feet wide and 14 feet long are significantly larger than standard shelter cages
at the opposite end of the shelter are the individual cat condos and three cat cotillions large rooms with open drawers cubbyholes and climbing poles where as many as 10 cats live and people can visit
all details are designed to bring out the best in the animals
the floors are soft waterproof epoxyfinished surfaces and the ceilings are soundabsorbent
the cacophony typical of kennels not only is unpleasant for people but also hurts the animals dogs can hear frequencies more than 20 khz higher than humans cats more than 45 khz higher
when a dog is in pain from the sound that elevates the stress level says emerson hughes owner of holiday barn pet resorts and former chairman of the richmond spca board who oversaw the project
although the creature comforts are as much for visitors deisler says mozart really does soothe the savage beast or confused puppy
in a study conducted at queens university in belfast psychologists found that heavymetal music increased anxiety in dogs and caused barking while classical music alleviated stress and quieted barking
the shelters classical music is digitally altered to put a damper on the ultrahigh and low frequencies
if they are too stressed out that reduces their immune system and that leads to them being sick and if they are sick we cant adopt them says deisler
but what an adoring public sees and hears in the adoption area is just a small part of the center
only about a quarter of the animals are available for adoption at any one time
the rest are being rehabbed
behind the scenes every animal gets a physical and behavioral checkup
dogs with contagious diseases like raspie a 4yearold sheltie with kennel cough are confined to the physical rehab room for treatment
staff experts work with personality problems in the behavioral rehab room
even healthy animals get a threeday adjustment period to acclimate to shelter life
zephia scarborough adopted a blackandwhite kitten she named steinway a few weeks ago
because he had been trapped inside a wall for several days before being rescued the kitten was traumatized
before taking steinway home she had to wait for him to come out of rehab
ten days later he was fat and happy and purring the richmond resident says
also hidden are the shelters command centers for its centrally controlled highpressure hydrocleaning system that borrows from car wash technology and its advanced airexchange system that sends fresh air throughout the building every six minutes
its good for reducing the spread of disease and the odors in the building and it has the side benefit of not collecting as much dust and hairballs says deisler
near the entrance is the spayneuter clinic
each year 18000 companion animals end up here or in one of the city or county shelters in the greater richmond area in the past half of those animals were euthanized
now the center spays or neuters every animal when it arrives and offers those services at low cost to the public
pet overpopulation is a nationwide problem of course
accurate numbers arent available but the humane society of the united states estimates that 8 million to 10 million dogs and cats enter u
shelters each year and that half are euthanized
locally the montgomery county humane society shelter the only one in the county took in 6650 dogs and cats in the year that ended in july and euthanized about 2600
animal shelter took in 9284 and euthanized 65 percent of them
how many dogs and cats would every person in the united states have to own to empty all of the shelters it just blew my mind she says
six cats and two dogs
on the second floor is a humane library a large auditorium that seats 300 people for educational programs and benefit events and a spectacular rubberpadded jogging track and training arena where all dogs are exercised and obedience classes are held
part of making this community nokill is youve got to provide good educational programs for people to understand how to do it says robin robertson starr executive director of the facility who expects the center to help 6000 to 8000 animals get adopted annually twice as many as the old shelter
at the forefront of a revolution in the pet care industry the richmond center is attracting international attention
since opening it has received 250 job and volunteer applications
besides 150 volunteers it employs 50 kennel workers and staffers whose annual salaries range from 20000 to 36000
people from other spcas nationwide call for tours
starr has participated in an international chat online and a conference in atlanta
the mayors alliance for animals in new york has contacted the richmond spca about how it is working with the city to solve the animal overpopulation problem
the centers nokill policy means it does not kill animals due to overpopulation
it takes in only animals that it can physically and behaviorally rehabilitate to an adoptable condition
all animals at the shelter stay there until they are adopted
we control admissions so as never to exceed our capacity says starr
even private kennels are upgrading facilities in what the american pet products and manufacturing association calls a 31 billion industry this month olde towne pet resort opened in springfield
billing itself as the ultimate pet care facility it offers services such as an indoor hydrotherapy pool and an indoor walking track and agility course
its more than just the building its the nokill policy
nokill is the real trend toward significant change says starr after whom the center was named along with patron e
in the first 10 months of this year 1200 fewer animals were euthanized by the richmond spca than in the same period the year before
some of the interest is in how the richmond spca raised 14
2 million in three years during an economic downturn
half of that went to build and half to operate the operating budget derived from donations is 2
5 million a year twice that of the old shelter
you work really hard says starr an attorney who worked full time those three years raising donations nearly all of them coming from the richmond community
outside her secondfloor office playing with her own 3yearold shaggy mutt named nibblet one of the four dogs and two cats she has adopted starr says people care a lot about the humane cause but people dont care a lot about continuing to throw their money at something that never changes
what worked in richmond she explains was presenting them with a problem that can be licked telling them how it can be licked
but whenever an animal shelter upgrades beyond concrete floors and clanky cages starr says someone always questions treating animals so well when homeless people are sleeping on the streets
i have trouble with that comparison she says
if we wanted to say that human homelessness is the cause that matters the most then that could also be said of the money that goes to art museums or the money that goes to botanical gardens or the performing arts
all of those are valuable things that improve the quality of our lives
they enormously improve the quality of our lives
interesting how you criticized her questions
curious as to why you didnt just answer them
ah but do ayatollah chex stay crunchy in milk
from this modern world your mind bender for today this definitely qualifies for the are they out of their frickin minds category
the geniuses in the bush admin are wooing iraqi ayatollah muhammad bakir alhakim based in iran as part of their attempt to go after saddam hussein
they are backing an ayatollah backed by the ayatollahs they consider part of an axis of evil for overthrowing the secular dictator they put and kept in power in order to help overthrow another part of the axis of evil led by a secular dictator they put and kept in power
mirs movie reviews 8mile good film
surprised by the acting abilities of eminiem
not a really big fan of the bond films but i have definitely seen worse

trailer for the two towers awesome
i like these types of films but im having a hard time dealing with the idea that ben affleck will be playing daredevil
and the chic playing elektra seems kinda lame
trailer for bad ass monk movie a must see

my thoughts and actions may or may not be the result of societal influence
interesting that you read societal mores are irrelevant to me
curious as to where that appears in the text
interesting that you read i think that each individual should determine their own responsibilities
curious as to where that appears in the text
interesting that you refer to
a governmental body or a group of individuals
curious as to where that appears in the text
let me rephrase are you stating that societal mores are irrevelant to you and that you think each individual should determine their own responsibilities as opposed to having it dictated to them by a governmental body or group of individuals
in my opinion these are questions that a society asks for itself
the universe pre during and posthuman doesnt care
the answers will vary from society to society as well as from individual to individual
all i ask is that you do not attempt to direct my responsibilities
i can manage them myself on my own terms
you know the more i think about this the more it just infuriates me
whats that asks zee bear
that some people believe that not everyone has the right to decent housing food clothes and health care
these are just fundamental rights
how could you deny someone these things could you honestly go up to a woman who is ill and cant work and tell herits just tough shit for her dont we as a society have a responsibility for each other now how thats going to be done can be debated and realistic solutions should be created
but to think that those things are wrong to begin with i just dont get that

and give julie our love and support
julie was admitted to the hospital yesterday
we went in for a routine check and the doctor saw something she did not like and sent julie down for observation
come to find out she was having contractions and did not even notice them
she is only 26 weeks so no one wants to see these babies born yet
they gave julie some medicine that did not stop the contractions
they then tried a different stronger medicine and it did not work either
by 5 oclock her very reserved doctor was visibly concerned about the situation
finally around 7 the contractions slowed
and have as of an hour ago stopped
julie will be in the hospital through at least tomorrow depending on how she reacts to being weened off the medication
after that though she will be on mandatory bedrest
so that means my availability for any of the group stuff road to glory dinner parties movies are highly suspect for the immediate future
i will let you know what changes

money and support but in the middle of dianna ortizs torture something distinctly inimical to torture happens
while her tormentors take a break she finds herself alone in a room with a figure curled under a bloodstained sheet
when dianna pulls back the sheet there is a woman who opens her eyes and they are light brown in the black and blue of her face
her teeth appear in the crack of her swollen lips
she is trying to smile
i catch a sob in my throat and gently take her hand
her breasts have been cut and maggots are crawling in them
the woman asks diannas name and says dianna be strong
for what seems like hours we hold on to each other
i guess the same could have been asked about the victorias secret fashion show tonight
